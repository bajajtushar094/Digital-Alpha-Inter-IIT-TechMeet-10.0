    "item_1": "ITEM 1 - BUSINESS\nCORPORATE BACKGROUND\nGeneral\nIntuit helps consumers, small businesses, and the self-employed prosper by delivering financial management and compliance products and services. We also provide specialized tax products to accounting professionals, who are key partners that help us serve small business customers.\nOur global products and platforms, including TurboTax, QuickBooks, Mint, and Credit Karma, are designed to help consumers and small businesses manage their finances, save money, pay off debt and do their taxes with ease and confidence so they are receiving the maximum refund they deserve. For those customers who run small businesses, we are focused on helping them get paid faster, pay their employees, access capital, ensure their books are done right and find and keep customers. We serve approximately 100 million customers across our product offerings and platforms. We had revenue of $9.6 billion in our fiscal year which ended July 31, 2021.\nIntuit Inc. was incorporated in California in March 1984.

All of our customers have a common set of needs. They are trying to make ends meet, maximize their tax refund, save money and pay off debt.\nThose who have made the bold decision to become entrepreneurs, and go into business for themselves, have an additional set of needs. They want to find and keep customers, get paid for their hard work, access capital to grow and ensure their books are right.\nAcross our platform, we use the power of technology to deliver three core benefits to our customers: helping put more money in their pockets, eliminating work and saving people time so they can focus on what matters to them, and ensuring that they have complete confidence in every financial decision they make.\nThe rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is fundamentally reshaping our world - and Intuit is taking advantage of this technological revolution to find new ways to deliver on our mission. We are focused on capitalizing on this opportunity to improve prosperity globally and inspire our workforce, while investing in our company\u2019s reputation and durable growth in the future.\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nOur Business Portfolio\nWe organize our businesses into four reportable segments:\nSmall Business & Self-Employed: This segment serves small businesses and the self-employed around the world, and the accounting professionals who assist and advise them. Our offerings include QuickBooks financial and business management online services and desktop software, payroll solutions, time tracking, merchant payment processing solutions, and financing for small businesses.\nConsumer: This segment serves consumers and includes do-it-yourself and assisted TurboTax income tax preparation products and services sold in the U.S. and Canada. Our Mint offering is a personal finance offering which helps customers track their finances and daily financial behaviors.\nCredit Karma: This segment serves consumers with a personal finance platform that provides personalized recommendations of credit card, home, auto and personal loan, and insurance products; online savings and checking accounts through our partner, MVB Bank, Inc., member FDIC; and access to their credit scores and reports, credit and identity monitoring, credit report dispute, and data-driven resources.\nProConnect: This segment serves professional accountants in the U.S. and Canada, who are essential to both small business success and tax preparation and filing. Our professional tax offerings include Lacerte, ProSeries, and ProConnect Tax Online in the U.S., and ProFile and ProTax Online in Canada.\nOur Growth Strategy\nAt Intuit, our strategy starts with customer obsession. We listen to and observe our customers, understand their challenges, and then use advanced technology, including AI, to develop innovative solutions designed to solve their most important financial problems. For more than three decades, we have reinvented and disrupted ourselves in order to ensure our customers are armed with the technology they need to grow and prosper.\nOur strategy for delivering on our bold goals is to become an AI-driven expert platform where we and others can solve our customers\u2019 most important problems. We plan to accelerate the development of the platform by applying AI in three key areas:\n\u2022An Open Platform: None of us can do it alone, including Intuit. The best way to deliver for customers is by creating an open, collaborative platform. It\u2019s the power of partnerships that accelerates the world\u2019s success. Our open technology platform integrates with partners so together we can deliver value and benefits that matter the most to our customers.\n\u2022Application of AI: AI helps our customers work smarter because we can automate, predict and personalize their experience. Using AI technologies, we are: leveraging machine learning to build decision engines and algorithms that learn from rich datasets to transform user experiences; applying knowledge engineering and turning compliance rules into code; and using natural language processing to revolutionize how customers interact with products and services.\n\u2022Incorporating Experts: One of the biggest problems our customers face is confidence. Even with current advances in technology that deliver personalized tools and insights, many people want to connect with a real person to help give them the confidence they are making the right decision. By bringing experts onto our platform we can solve this massive problem for customers. The power of our virtual expert platform allows us to scale the intelligence of our products, elevating experts to advisors and delivering big benefits for customers.\nAs we build our AI-driven expert platform, we are prioritizing our resources on five strategic priorities across the company. These priorities focus on solving the problems that matter most to customers and include:\n\u2022Revolutionizing speed to benefit: When customers use our products and services, we aim to deliver value instantly by making the interactions with our offerings frictionless, without the need for customers to manually enter data. We are accelerating the application of AI with a goal to revolutionize the customer experience. This priority is foundational across our business, and execution against it positions us to succeed with our other four strategic priorities.\n\u2022Connecting people to experts: The largest problem our customers face is lack of confidence to file their own taxes or to manage their books. To build their confidence, we are connecting our customers to experts. We offer customers access to experts to help them make important decisions - and experts, such as accountants, gain access to new customers so they can grow their businesses.\n\u2022Unlocking smart money decisions: Crippling high-cost debt and lack of savings are at unprecedented levels across the U.S. To address these challenges, we are creating a personal financial assistant that helps consumers find the right financial products, put more money in their pockets and access financial expertise and advice. Our acquisition of Credit Karma accelerates our ability to achieve this vision, by combining two trusted brands, customer reach, data and platform capabilities to deliver breakthrough benefits that will power prosperity for customers around the world.\n\u2022Be the center of small business growth: We are focused on helping customers grow their businesses by offering a broad, seamless set of tools that are designed to help them get paid faster, manage and get access to capital, pay\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nemployees with confidence, and use third-party apps to help run their businesses. At the same time, we want to position ourselves to better serve product-based businesses to benefit customers who sell products through multiple channels.\n\u2022Disrupt the small business mid-market: We aim to disrupt the mid-market with QuickBooks Online Advanced, our online offering designed to address the needs of small business customers with 10 to 100 employees. This offering enables us to increase retention of these larger customers, and attract new mid-market customers who are over-served by available offerings.\nAs the external environment evolves, we continue to innovate and adapt our strategy and anticipate our customers\u2019 needs. For more than 35 years, we have been dedicated to developing innovative financial and compliance products and services that are easy to use and are available where and when customers need them. As a result, our customers actively recommend our products and solutions to others, which is one important way that we measure the success of our strategy.\nPRODUCTS AND SERVICES\nDuring fiscal 2021 we offered our products and services in the four segments described in \u201cBusiness Overview\u201d above. The following table shows the revenue for each of these segments over the last three fiscal years.\nFiscal 2021 Fiscal 2020 Fiscal 2019\nSmall Business & Self-Employed 49 % 53 % 52 %\nConsumer 37 % 41 % 41 %\nCredit Karma (1)\n9 % - % - %\nProConnect 5 % 6 % 7 %\n(1) Credit Karma revenue from December 3, 2020\nTotal international net revenue was less than 5% of consolidated total net revenue for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nFor financial information about our reportable segments, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Item 7 and Note 14 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nSmall Business & Self-Employed\nOur Small Business & Self-Employed segment serves small businesses and the self-employed around the world, and the accounting professionals who assist and advise them. Our goal is for QuickBooks to be the source of truth for each small business customer who uses our integrated platform. We work to make this a reality through our three-pillared growth strategy: Grow the Core by transforming financial management software and meeting customers where they are; Connect the Ecosystem, by meeting a wider range of customer needs with a single integrated platform; and expand our geographic footprint globally, by serving small businesses around the world. With this strategy we enable a powerful ecosystem, personalized using artificial intelligence, to deliver a suite of right-for-me solutions to a wide range of customers globally.\nOur integrated platform includes:\nQuickBooks Online. Our QuickBooks financial management solutions help small businesses, the self-employed, and accountants solve financial and compliance problems, make more money and reduce unnecessary work, while giving them complete confidence in their actions and decisions. Users can track income and expenses, create and send invoices and estimates, manage and pay bills, and review a variety of financial reports. QuickBooks Live enables our customers to obtain live bookkeeping advice from professionals. QuickBooks Online also comes with a powerful mobile app available on iOS and Android which enables customers to run their entire business from their phone. The app provides the customers instant access to their QuickBooks data and includes powerful features that take advantage of mobile technology such as automatically tracking business miles or the ability to upload a picture of a receipt.\nQuickBooks Online is an open platform, enabling third-party developers to create online and mobile applications that integrate with our offering. A growing number of companies offer applications built for our QuickBooks platform, including PayPal, Shopify and Square.\nQuickBooks Desktop Software. Our QuickBooks financial management solutions are also available as desktop versions for small businesses.\nIn addition to our core QuickBooks offering, we also offer specific solutions for the following customer segments:\n\u2022Mid-Market Small Businesses. Our QuickBooks Online Advanced and QuickBooks Enterprise offerings are designed for small businesses with 10 to 100 employees that have more complex needs. QuickBooks Online Advanced, Intuit\u2019s cloud-based offering, is specifically designed for high-growth, mid-market small businesses and leverages AI, automation and data insights to deliver more ways for them to grow and scale.

This offering provides industry-specific reports and features for a range of industries, including Contractor, Manufacturing and Wholesale, Nonprofit, and Retail.\n\u2022Self-Employed. QuickBooks Self-Employed is designed specifically for self-employed customers whose needs are different than small businesses that use QuickBooks. Features include categorizing business and personal transactions, identifying and classifying tax deductible expenses, tracking mileage, calculating estimated quarterly taxes and sending invoices. QuickBooks Self-Employed can be combined with TurboTax to export and pay year-end taxes. QuickBooks Self-Employed is available both online and via a mobile application.\n\u2022Product-Based Businesses. With QuickBooks Commerce, product-based businesses such as online sellers are able to access inventory and sales from multiple sales channels, manage orders and fulfillment, sync inventory across online and offline channels to avoid stockouts and gain profitability insights. QuickBooks Commerce also helps small businesses attract and sell to new customers across multiple channels and ultimately grow their business.\n\u2022Accountants. QuickBooks Online Accountant and QuickBooks Accountant Desktop Plus are available to accounting professionals who use QuickBooks offerings and recommend them to their small business clients. These offerings provide the tools and file-sharing capabilities that accounting professionals need to efficiently complete bookkeeping and financial reporting tasks as well as manage their practices. We also offer memberships to the QuickBooks ProAdvisor program, which provides accountants access to QuickBooks Online Accountant, QuickBooks Accountant Desktop Plus, QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise Accountant, QuickBooks Point of Sale Desktop, technical support, training, product certification, marketing tools, and discounts on Intuit products and services purchased on behalf of clients.\nEcosystem Services\nEmployer Solutions (Payroll and Time Tracking).

Certain online offerings also include same day direct deposit, access to human resource advice, and access to additional expert-powered services like Tax Penalty Protection. QuickBooks Desktop payroll is available in both a self-service and an assisted version, depending on whether customers want to do their own taxes or leverage automated tax payments and filings. We also offer QuickBooks Time which seamlessly integrates with QuickBooks Payroll and third-party payroll products to help businesses easily and accurately track time across a mobile workforce, including tools for project planning, job costing, and tracking per-client billable hours.\nPayment Processing Solutions.

We offer instant deposit options for eligible customers.

Our Payments offering is also connected with QuickBooks Cash, our small business banking solution, through integrated onboarding and instant funds availability. In addition to transaction processing services, our services include broad customer support, merchant and consumer collections, chargeback and retrieval support, and fraud and loss prevention screening.\nCapital for Small Businesses. We offer financing options for small businesses to help them get the capital they need to succeed. The financing process provides small businesses the ability to use their QuickBooks data to qualify to borrow capital.\nQuickBooks Cash. The QuickBooks Cash business bank account with debit card adds banking capabilities to QuickBooks\u2019 robust business offerings.

Within this segment, we also offer Mint, which is an online personal finance offering aimed at helping customers track their finances and daily financial behaviors. Our online offerings can be accessed on mobile devices.\nTax Return Preparation Offerings. For the 2020 tax season, we offered a variety of commercial software products and tax filing services to meet the different needs of our customers, including those filing simple returns, those who itemize deductions, own investments or rental property, and small business owners. Customers can electronically file their federal and state income tax returns through our electronic filing service. We also offered TurboTax Live for customers seeking to obtain tax advice from professionals, TurboTax Live Full Service for customers seeking to have their tax returns prepared for them, as well as audit defense and audit support services. Our online tax preparation and filing services were offered through the websites of thousands of financial institutions, electronic retailers, and other online merchants. Financial institutions can offer our online tax preparation and filing services to their customers through a link to TurboTax Online. Our TurboTax U.S. and Canada offerings consist of desktop, online, and mobile offerings. In addition to our commercial product offerings, for the 2020 tax season we were a member of the Free File Alliance, a consortium of private sector companies that has entered into an agreement with the federal government to donate free online federal tax preparation and filing services to the IRS, which the IRS then markets to eligible consumers on an IRS website. At the conclusion of this tax season in October, we will no longer participate in the Free File Alliance. See also \u201cCompetition - Consumer Segment\u201d later in this Item 1 for more information on the Free File Alliance.\nCredit Karma\nOur Credit Karma segment provides consumers with a financial platform that helps them find the right financial products and put more money in their pockets. The platform offers a number of free services to its members: access to their credit scores and reports, credit and identity monitoring, credit report dispute, data-driven resources, personalized recommendations of credit card, loan, and insurance products and online savings and checking accounts through our bank partner, MVB Bank, Inc., Member FDIC. To provide these services to its members, Credit Karma works with a variety of partners, including credit bureaus, banks, credit card issuers, and other financial institutions and lending partners. Additionally, Credit Karma leverages Lightbox, a first-of-its-kind enterprise platform which allows lenders to leverage thousands of de-identified data points from Credit Karma members to help provide its members with greater certainty that they will be approved if they apply for a financial product.\nProConnect\nOur ProConnect segment includes our professional tax offerings and serves professional accountants in the U.S. and Canada, who are essential to both small business success and tax preparation and filing. Our professional tax offerings consist of Lacerte, ProSeries, and ProConnect Tax Online in the U.S., and ProFile and ProTax Online in Canada. These offerings enable accountants to accurately and efficiently complete and electronically file a full range of consumer, small business, and commercial federal and state tax returns. Lacerte is designed for full-service year-round accounting firms who handle more complex returns. ProSeries is designed for year-round tax practices handling moderately complex tax returns. ProConnect Tax Online is our cloud-based solution, which is designed for full-service year-round practices who prepare all forms of consumer and small business returns and integrates with our QuickBooks Online offerings. ProFile is our Canadian desktop tax offering, which serves year-round full-service accounting firms for both consumer and business tax returns. ProTax Online is our Canadian cloud based tax solution, which is designed for full-service year-round practices who prepare all forms of consumer and business tax returns, and is fully integrated into QuickBooks Online Accountant to provide seamless integration of data across books and tax through our Workpapers solution. We also offer a variety of tax-related services that complement the tax return preparation process including year-round document storage, collaboration services, e-signature, and bank products, and additional capabilities such as fixed asset management, desktop hosting, and third party solutions for practice management for some of our U.S. tax offerings.\nPRODUCT DEVELOPMENT\nThe markets for software and related services are characterized by rapid technological change, shifting customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements. Continuous investment is required to innovate and develop new products and services as well as enhance existing offerings to be successful in these markets. Our product development efforts are more important than ever as we pursue our growth strategy.\nWe develop many of our products and services internally, and we have a number of United States and foreign patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology. We also supplement our internal development efforts by acquiring or licensing products and technology from third parties, and establishing other relationships that enable us to enhance or expand our offerings more rapidly. We expect to expand our third-party technology relationships as we continue to pursue our growth strategy.\nOur online offerings and mobile applications have rapid development cycles, while our traditional desktop software products tend to have predictable annual development and product release cycles. In addition, developing consumer and professional tax software and services presents unique challenges because of the demanding development cycle required to accurately incorporate federal and state tax law and tax form changes within a rigid timetable. The development timing for our small\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nbusiness payroll and merchant payment processing services offerings varies with business needs and regulatory requirements, and the length of the development cycle depends on the scope and complexity of each project.\nWe continue to make substantial investments in research and development, and we expect to focus our future research and development efforts on enhancing existing products and services with financial recommendations, personalization, and ease of use enabled by AI and other advanced technologies. We continue to focus on developing new products and services, including new mobile and global offerings, and significant research and development efforts for ongoing projects to update the technology platforms for several of our offerings.\nSEASONALITY\nOur Consumer and ProConnect offerings have a significant and distinct seasonal pattern as sales and revenue from our income tax preparation products and services are typically concentrated in the period from November through April. This seasonal pattern typically results in higher net revenues during our second and third quarters ending January 31 and April 30, respectively.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the timing of tax filing seasons for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 varied significantly. In fiscal 2019, the IRS began accepting returns on January 28, 2019 and the tax filing deadline was April 15, 2019. In fiscal 2020, the IRS began accepting returns on January 27, 2020 and the tax filing deadline was July 15, 2020. In fiscal 2021, the IRS began accepting returns on February 12, 2021 and the tax filing deadline was May 17, 2021. These changes to the tax filing seasons impacted our quarterly financial results during fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020.\nWe expect the seasonality of our Consumer and ProConnect businesses to continue to have a significant impact on our quarterly financial results in the future.\nMARKETING, SALES AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS\nMarkets\nOur primary customers are consumers, small businesses, and the self-employed. We also provide specialized tax and accounting products to professional accountants, who are key partners to help us reach small business customers. The markets in which we compete have always been characterized by rapid technological change, shifting customer needs, and frequent new product introductions and enhancements by competitors. Over the past several years, the widespread usage of mobile devices and the explosion of social media have accelerated the pace of change and revolutionized the way that customers learn about, evaluate, and purchase products and services.\nReal-time, personalized online and mobile shopping experiences are the standard. In addition, many customers now begin shopping in one channel and ultimately purchase in another. This has created a need for integrated, multi-channel, shop-and-buy experiences. Market and industry changes quickly make existing products and services obsolete. Our success depends on our ability to respond rapidly to these changes with new business models, updated competitive strategies, new or enhanced products and services, alternative distribution methods, and other changes in the way we do business.\nMarketing Programs\nWe use a variety of marketing programs to generate direct sales, develop leads, increase general awareness of our product portfolio, and drive sales in retail. These programs include digital marketing such as display and pay-per-click advertising, search engine optimization, and social and affiliate marketing; mobile marketing through online app stores; email marketing; offline marketing such as TV, radio, billboard, magazine and newspaper advertising; retail marketing; public relations; and in product marketing to drive awareness of related products and services. Our campaigns are designed to attract new users, retain existing users, and cross sell additional offerings.\nSales and Distribution Channels\nMulti-Channel Shop-and-Buy Experiences. Our customers use the web and mobile devices to research products and services. Some customers buy and use our products and services entirely online or through their mobile devices. Others research online but make their purchase at a retail location. Because many customers shop across multiple channels, we continue to coordinate our online, offline, and retail presence and promotions to support an integrated, multi-channel, shop-and-buy model. We also focus on cross-selling complementary Intuit and third-party offerings online and in-product.\nDirect Sales Channel. We sell many of our products and services directly through our websites and call centers. Direct, online sales are an effective channel for customers who can make purchase decisions based on content provided on our websites, via other online content or word of mouth recommendations. Telesales continues to be an effective channel for serving customers that want live help to select the products and services that are right for their needs. We also have a direct sales force that calls on U.S. and international accounting firms and seeks to increase their awareness, usage, and recommendation of our small business and professional tax solutions. For mid-market businesses, we have implemented and expanded on our omni channel go to market strategy by diversifying and growing our technology partner channel and industry focused direct sales teams.\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nMobile Application Stores. We distribute many of our offerings for mobile devices through proprietary online stores that provide applications for specific devices. These include the Apple App Store and Google\u2019s Play Store.\nPartner and Other Channels. We sell our products and services through partners including value-added resellers, system integrators (including accountants), and managed service providers who help us reach new customers at the point of need and drive growth and market share by extending our online reach. These partners combine our products and services with marketing, sales, and technical expertise to deliver a complete solution at the local level. We also sell our QuickBooks and TurboTax desktop software as well as payroll services at retail locations across the United States and Canada and on retailer websites. In Canada, we also rely on distributors who sell products into the retail channel.\nCOMPETITION\nOverview\nWe face intense competition in all of our businesses, both domestically and internationally. Competitive interest and expertise in many of the markets we serve have grown markedly over the past few years and we expect this trend to continue. Some of our existing competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. In addition, the competitive landscape can shift rapidly as new companies enter and existing companies expand their businesses to include the markets in which we compete. This is particularly true for online and mobile products and services, where the barriers to entry are lower than they are for desktop software products and services. To attract customers, many online and mobile competitors are offering free or low-priced products which we must take into account in our pricing strategies.\nGiven the breadth of the products and services that we offer as a global technology company, we compete with the offerings from a variety of companies across a range of industries. Our most obvious competition comes from other companies that currently offer technology solutions similar to ours. In our Small Business & Self-Employed segment, we face competition from a variety of companies that provide products or services to address the problems that we help our customers to solve, including getting paid faster, paying their employees, accessing capital and ensuring their books are done right. Our Consumer segment competes with companies that offer products and services to help customers file their taxes, better manage their money and reduce their debt. We may also face competition from companies with platforms that could be developed to offer competing technology solutions to any of the problems that our customers may face, such as Facebook, Amazon and Google. In addition, for many of our products and services, other competitive alternatives for customers are third-party service providers such as professional accountants and seasonal tax preparation businesses. Manual tools and processes, or general-purpose software, are also important competitive alternatives. In some cases, a competitor in one of our segments may be our partner in another one of our segments. In other cases, a company may compete with us in more than one of our segments.\nCompetition Specific to Segments\nSmall Business & Self-Employed Segment. QuickBooks is a leading small business financial management software in the U.S. Small businesses often look to several companies to address their problems. Therefore, our small business products and services face competitive challenges from a variety of companies that provide products or services that address one or more of their problems. We compete to help small businesses get their books right with Xero, The Sage Group plc, and FreshBooks, among others, which offer software and associated services as well as online accounting offerings that directly serve small business customers. For small businesses with more complex financial management needs, our competitors include The Sage Group plc\u2019s Intacct offering and Microsoft Dynamics. We also compete with free or low-cost online accounting offerings, and free online banking and bill payment services offered by financial institutions and others. In our payroll business we compete directly with Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP), Paychex, Gusto, and many other companies that help small businesses to pay their employees. In our merchant services business we help our customers get paid faster and compete directly with large financial institutions such as Wells Fargo, JP Morgan Chase, and Bank of America and with many payment processors, including First Data Corporation, Elavon, Global Payments, Fidelity National Information Services, PayPal, and Square. Our QuickBooks Capital offering, which helps small businesses to access capital, competes with a range of lending enterprises, including large financial institutions, such as the ones listed above, fintech companies, such as Square and PayPal, and others.\nConsumer Segment. In our Consumer segment, we compete to help our customers to file their taxes. Our future growth depends on our ability to attract new customers to the self-preparation tax category and to our assisted offering, TurboTax Live, from tax stores and other tax preparers. In the U.S. private sector we face intense competition from H&R Block, which provides tax preparation services in its stores and a competing software offering. We also face competition from several other large tax preparation service providers, from a myriad of small tax preparers, and from numerous online self-preparation offerings, including Blucora\u2019s TaxAct, Free Tax USA, TaxSlayer, and Square. Some of these competitors are offering electronic tax preparation and filing services at no cost to individual taxpayers. In Canada, our TurboTax Canada offerings face competition from H&R Block, SimpleTax, StudioTax, and UFile, among others. These competing offerings subject us to significant price pressure in both the U.S. and Canada. We also face competitive challenges from government entities that offer publicly funded electronic tax preparation and filing services with no fees to individual taxpayers. Our Mint offering competes with numerous personal financial management companies and large financial institutions to help our customers track their finances and better manage their money.\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nFor the 2020 tax season, we were a member of the Free File Alliance, a consortium of private sector companies that has entered into an agreement with the federal government. Under this agreement, the member companies donate online federal tax preparation and filing services to eligible users at no cost to the government or individual users separate and apart from the member companies\u2019 commercial free offerings, which the IRS then offers to eligible consumers on an IRS website. Approximately 22 states and the District of Columbia have also entered public-private partnerships with the Free File Alliance. Additionally, certain member companies, including Intuit, provided online state tax preparation and filing services at no cost if the taxpayer qualified for the free federal return under this program. We will no longer participate in the Free File Alliance after the conclusion of the 2020 tax season in October. We continue to actively work with others in the private and public sectors to support successful public-private partnerships that reinforce the voluntary compliance tax system, encourage electronic filing, and inform consumers of free filing options. However, future administrative, regulatory, or legislative activity in this area could seek to replace the voluntary compliance tax system with return preparation, or self preparation options, provided by government agencies which could harm our Consumer business.\nCredit Karma Segment. Credit Karma faces significant competition for member growth and partnerships. Credit Karma competes against many companies to attract and engage members, including the credit bureaus as well as companies that provide personal finance management products and tools which offer a variety of credit-score monitoring and personal finance services and content. Credit Karma faces competition with some elements of businesses of LendingTree, Red Ventures, NerdWallet, Square, Chime, among others. However, the personal finance industry is evolving rapidly and is becoming increasingly competitive. An increasing number of companies are competing directly with Credit Karma.\nProConnect Segment. In the U.S., Lacerte professional tax offerings face competition from competitively-priced tax and accounting solutions that include integration with non-tax functionality. These include CCH\u2019s ProSystem fx Office Suite and Thomson Reuters\u2019 CS Professional Suite and GoSystem Tax. Our ProSeries professional tax offerings face competition from CCH\u2019s ATX and TaxWise offerings, Drake, and other smaller providers. In Canada, our ProFile professional tax offerings face competition from CCH\u2019s Cantax and Taxprep offerings, TaxCycle, and Thomson Reuters\u2019 DTMax and UFile Pro offerings. We also face growing competition from online tax and accounting offerings in the U.S. and Canada, which may be marketed more effectively or have lower pricing than our offerings for accounting professionals.\nCompetitive Factors\nWe believe the most important competitive factors for our core offerings - QuickBooks, TurboTax, Lacerte, ProSeries, and Credit Karma - are ease of use, product features, size of the installed customer base, size of membership base, member engagement, brand name recognition, value proposition, cost, reliability, security, and product and support quality. Access to distribution channels is also important for our QuickBooks and TurboTax desktop software products. In addition, support from accounting professionals and the ability for customers to upgrade within product families as their businesses grow are significant competitive factors for our QuickBooks products. Productivity is an important competitive factor for the full-service accounting firms to which we market our Lacerte software products. We believe we compete effectively on these factors as our QuickBooks and TurboTax products are the leading products in the U.S. for their respective categories.\nFor our service offerings such as small business payroll and merchant payment processing, we believe the most important competitive factors are functionality, ease of use, high availability, security, the integration of these products with related software, brand name recognition, effective distribution, quality of support, and cost.\nCUSTOMER SUCCESS\nFor our QuickBooks, TurboTax, ProConnect and Mint offerings, we provide product support and technical support through channels including telephone, e-mail, online and video chat, text messaging, our customer support websites, self-help assets embedded in our products, and online communities where consumers can share knowledge and product advice with each other.\nWe also provide access to experts, through our TurboTax and QuickBooks Live offerings, who provide tax advice, tax preparation and bookkeeping services.\nOur customer success staff predominantly consists of Intuit-employed and outsourced experts. We supplement with seasonal employees and additional outsourcing during periods of peak call volumes, such as during the tax return filing season or following a major product launch. We outsource to several firms domestically and internationally. Most of our internationally outsourced small business customer success personnel are currently located in the Philippines.\nWe also source staff through our Prosperity Hub program, which is designed to spark economic prosperity for people and communities in need. One part of this program is our socially responsible sourcing model, where we both directly and through customer success partner-employers, hire, train, and retain workers who deliver support and services for our customers.\nSelf-help information is offered for free in-product and on our support websites for our QuickBooks, TurboTax, Mint and professional tax offerings. Support alternatives and fees vary by product. For example, some product subscriptions receive 24x7 support and additional contact channel options.\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nPARTNER SUCCESS\nFor our Credit Karma offerings we have a Partner Success team that is dedicated to ensuring that our financial institution partners operate efficiently and safely on our platform. This team consists of program management, operations, and compliance professionals, who interface directly with lending partners to facilitate new product launches; maintain product offers, including any updates to existing offers and compliance monitoring; manage and maintain data required for offers and partner invoicing; support audits and compliance reviews; and manage and resolve incidents to mitigate any potential negative impact on either Credit Karma\u2019s or the partner\u2019s platform.\nMANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION\nOnline Products and Services\nOur online offerings include QuickBooks Online, online payroll services, merchant payment processing services, TurboTax Online, ProConnect Tax Online, consumer and professional electronic tax filing services, Mint, and Turbo. We recently completed the transition of our systems, networks and databases used to operate these online offerings to public cloud providers, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS). Currently, all of our online offerings are operating using AWS.\nDesktop Software and Supplies\nAlthough an increasing proportion of our desktop software customers choose to electronically download software, many customers continue to choose to purchase these products in the form of physical media. The key processes in manufacturing desktop software are manufacturing compact discs (CDs) and digital video discs (DVDs), printing boxes and related materials, and assembling and shipping the final products.\nFor retail manufacturing and distribution, we have agreements with Arvato Digital Services, Inc. (Arvato), a division of Bertelsmann AG, under which Arvato provides a majority of the manufacturing volume for our launches of QuickBooks and TurboTax and day-to-day replenishment after product launches, as well as our retail distribution logistics. Arvato also provides most of the manufacturing volume and distribution services for our direct desktop software orders.\nCustomers typically receive desktop software electronically. However, when physical product is ordered, we typically ship the physical product within a few days of receiving an order and backlog is minimal.\nPRIVACY AND SECURITY OF CUSTOMER AND WORKFORCE INFORMATION AND TRANSACTIONS\nWe are stewards of our customers\u2019 data and have designed data stewardship principles to align our organization in collecting, using and protecting such information. As we believe strongly in being good stewards of our customers\u2019 data, we operate our program to comply with laws and regulations that govern our use, sharing and protection of customers\u2019 personal information, including, for example, laws with respect to financial services and the handling of tax data. We have established guidelines and practices to help ensure that customers and members of our workforce are aware of, and can control, how we use information about them. We also use privacy statements to provide notice to customers of our privacy practices, as well as provide them the opportunity to furnish instructions with respect to use of their personal information. We participate in industry groups whose purpose is to develop or shape industry best practices, and to inform public policy for privacy and security.\nWe use security safeguards to help protect the systems and the information that customers and members of our workforce give to us from loss, misuse and unauthorized alteration. We use technical, logical and procedural measures, such as multi-factor authentication, which are designed to help detect and prevent fraud and misuse of customer information. Whenever customers transmit sensitive information to us, such as credit card information or tax return data, through one of our websites or products, we follow current industry standards to encrypt the data as it is transmitted to us, and when we store it at rest. We routinely patch our systems with security updates and we work to protect our systems from unauthorized internal or external access using numerous commercially available computer security products as well as internally developed security procedures and practices.\nGOVERNMENT REGULATION\nOur Consumer and ProConnect segments are subject to federal, state and international government requirements, including regulations related to the electronic filing of tax returns, the provision of tax preparer assistance, and the use and disclosure of customer information. Our Small Business & Self-Employed segment offers products and services to small businesses and consumers, such as payroll, payments, and financing, which are also subject to certain regulatory requirements. Our Credit Karma segment offers personal finance products and services to consumers, such as recommendations of credit card, loan and insurance products and access to credit scores and reports, which are also subject to certain regulatory requirements.\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nOur success depends on the proprietary technology embodied in our offerings. We protect this proprietary technology by relying on a variety of intellectual property mechanisms, including copyright, patent, trade secret and trademark laws, restrictions on disclosure and other methods. For example, we regularly file applications for patents, copyrights and trademarks and service marks in order to protect intellectual property that we believe is important to our business. We hold a growing patent portfolio that we believe is important to Intuit\u2019s overall competitive advantage, although we are not materially dependent on any one patent or particular group of patents in our portfolio at this time. We also have a number of registered trademarks that include Intuit, QuickBooks, Lacerte, TurboTax, QB, ProSeries, ProConnect, Mint, and Credit Karma. We have registered these and other trademarks and service marks in the United States and, depending on the relevance of each brand to other markets, in many foreign countries. Most registrations can be renewed perpetually at 10-year intervals. We also license intellectual property from third parties for use in our products.\nAlthough our portfolio of patents is growing, the patents that have been issued to us could be determined to be invalid and may not be enforceable against competitive products in every jurisdiction. In addition, third parties have asserted and may, in the future, assert infringement claims against us and our customers. These claims and any litigation may result in invalidation of our proprietary rights or a finding of infringement along with an assessment of damages. Litigation, even if without merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. In addition, third-party licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, or at all.\nHUMAN CAPITAL\nWe consider our employees one of our four True North key stakeholders because they help us deliver for the customers, shareholders and the communities we serve. As of July 31, 2021, we had approximately 13,500 employees in 10 countries. During fiscal 2021, we employed on average approximately 7,700 seasonal employees from January to May primarily to support our Consumer segment customers during the peak of tax season. We believe our future success and growth will depend on our ability to attract and retain a qualified workforce in all areas of our business.\nIntuit\u2019s workforce development strategies are developed and managed by our Chief People & Places Officer, who reports to the CEO. The Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of the Board of Directors has oversight with respect to company-wide organization and talent assessment, employee recruitment, engagement and retention, leadership development, management depth and strength assessment, workplace environment and culture, employee health and safety, and pay equity. Of the total number of employees, approximately 1,300 are employed by Credit Karma, which was acquired by Intuit in December 2020 and has certain unique compensation and workforce development programs. We regularly collect, measure and share the sentiment of our workforce through multiple channels, including engagement surveys, and other touch points, which help to guide the work we do to support our workforce.\nCulture and Values\nIn order to deliver on our mission to power prosperity around the world, we are guided by our company values as we strive to create a culture where employees can do the best work of their lives. Our value of Courage means being bold and fearless in how we think and act, holding a high bar for performance and valuing speed, a bias for learning and action. Our value of Stronger Together means championing diversity, inclusion and a respectful environment, thriving on diverse voices to challenge and inform decisions and delivering exceptional work so others can count on us. Consistent with our value of We Care and Give Back, we provide eligible full-time employees five days of paid time off every year that can be used to do volunteer work during normal work hours for vetted non-profits. Our We Care and Give Back program also provides donation matching up to an annual limit.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion1\nAt the foundation of our culture is a commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion (\u201cDEI\u201d). We believe that diversity is a fact, but treating people equitably and inclusively are choices we make. To deliver for our customers, we seek to foster a workforce that is as diverse as the communities we serve. When we do this, we believe we develop deeper empathy, accelerating innovation to solve the biggest problems our customers face. We have had a designated role dedicated to diversity and inclusion since 2015. In fiscal 2021, we invested additional resources into DEI and appointed our first Chief Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Officer (\u201cCDEIO\u201d) who leads a new dedicated and specialized team in our DEI efforts. Our Compensation and Organizational Development Committee oversees Intuit\u2019s DEI initiatives in support of organizational development. Our strategy is operationalized through the following elements:\n\u2022Goals and transparency: We have set short- and long-term goals for increasing the representation of women and under-represented minorities (which we define as Black/African-American, Latino/Hispanic, Native American, Native Alaskan and Native Hawaiian) in our workforce. Our progress is reviewed monthly with all executives and we have shared our diversity externally since 2015;\n1 Excludes Credit Karma, which we acquired in December 2020.\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\n\u2022Center of Excellence: We have a cross-functional team led by the CDEIO with expertise in enterprise leadership, strategy, human resources and communications all focused on driving a more diverse and inclusive workplace;\n\u2022Employee Resource Groups: 13 employee resource groups aid in creating community, recruiting, on-boarding and providing safe spaces for our diverse workforce;\n\u2022Engagement: A dedicated DEI survey focused on the experiences of our workforce;\n\u2022REAL Team: A Racial Equity Leadership Team focused on helping us drive durable change as we strive to continue advancing racial equity and equality;\n\u2022Education: All senior leaders have attended multiple DEI workshops, including C-suite training on racial equity. We have manager and employee training on leading inclusively and a guide for managers on how to have conversations about difficult and polarizing external events;\n\u2022Assessment: Biannual formal talent reviews, including succession plans and diversity assessments;\n\u2022Talent acquisition: We have developed a program team to drive diversity strategy and initiatives; and\n\u2022Accountability: The Compensation and Organizational Development Committee reviews our progress towards our goals and workforce diversity initiatives at least annually.\nAs of July 31, 2021:\n\u2022Women constituted 40% of our total employees, 35% of our leadership roles, and 30% of our technology roles; and\n\u2022Our under-represented minority employees represent 13% of our U.S. employees, 8% of our U.S. leadership roles, and 7% of our U.S. technology roles.\nThe company performs an ongoing pay equity analysis, conducted twice a year by an independent, third-party vendor. This analysis allows us to review each job code where there are enough employees that have the same or similar job duties and compensation mix. We compare base pay by gender and ethnicity, while factoring in location and time spent in the role, and make adjustments when there are unexplained statistical differences. We are transparent about our pay equity results and have multiple avenues for employees to use for any questions about their pay.\nDeveloping Talent and Training\nWe are committed to creating a high-performing culture that consistently delivers for our customers, shareholders and communities while providing an experience for our workforce that values leadership, innovation, and collaboration. We promote the development of all of our employees through our One Intuit Learning Vision that every employee has a personalized learning plan based on their needs and interests, and are provided the resources they need to grow, thrive and reinvent themselves over time.\nIn addition, we are invested in growing our current and future leaders. Our Learning and Development teams design programs and resources to develop our employees and measure their progress.\nAll full-time employees have access to opportunities to develop and learn through over 1,400 Intuit-sponsored learning paths and online courses on topics ranging from artificial intelligence to manager essentials in support of an employee\u2019s ability to adapt to any work environment. In fiscal 2021, our full-time employees completed over 170,000 pieces of learning content.\nEmployees set goals and measure progress through our goal setting tool and have opportunities to focus on growth both during year-end conversations and ongoing monthly check-ins.\nTotal Rewards\nOur compensation philosophy aims to attract and retain top talent for today and the future. Intuit\u2019s total target compensation includes base hourly pay or salary at market-competitive rates, equity and a range of incentive plans that vary based on role. Incentive compensation plans are part of our pay for performance philosophy and closely align with company performance and reward top performance. Most year-round employees are eligible for equity, which allows the majority of our employees to share in the company\u2019s success.\nAdditional benefits and rewards include an employee stock purchase plan, healthcare and retirement benefits, paid time off, annual paid recharge days, family and parental leave.\nCOVID Response and Well-being\nThe health and well-being of our employees and their families has never been more important. We offer our employees (excluding experts) a reimbursement incentive to cover the costs of purchases made to support their physical, emotional and financial well-being. Employees also have access to other resources to help with their well-being, including a well-minds program for resilience, mindfulness and counseling, back-up childcare, financial education programs and access to an Employee Assistance Program.\nAmid the unprecedented environment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, management\u2019s top priority has been the health and safety of our employees. We shifted nearly all our workforce from office locations to work from home environments. We also increased leave benefits for all employees to allow them to take care of what matters most to them. We provided our\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nemployees with resources to have a complete and comfortable home workspace, to offset certain pandemic-related expenses and to promote physical and emotional health.\nINFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS\nThe following table shows Intuit\u2019s executive officers and their areas of responsibility as of July 31, 2021 .

    "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nOur businesses routinely encounter and address risks, many of which could cause our future results to be materially different than we presently anticipate. Below, we describe significant factors, events and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky, categorized solely for ease of reference as strategic, operational, legal and compliance, and financial risks. The following events and consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, credit rating and reputation, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. These risks are not the only ones we face. We could also be affected by other events, factors or uncertainties that are presently unknown to us or that we do not currently consider to present significant risks to our business. These risks may be amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused significant global economic instability and uncertainty. The manner in which we respond to future developments as well as our competitors\u2019 reactions to those developments may affect our future operating results.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant economic instability and uncertainty and the extent to which it will impact our business, results of operations and financial condition is uncertain and difficult to predict.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused economic instability and uncertainty globally and, during its initial phase, had a temporary negative impact on our business. The pandemic may, in the future, have a material adverse impact on our business and financial performance, the severity and duration of which will depend on many factors beyond our control, including the actions of governments, businesses and other enterprises in response to the pandemic, the effectiveness of those actions, and vaccine availability, distribution and adoption. Potential and current negative impacts of the pandemic include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022The extension of federal and state tax filing deadlines for the 2019 and 2020 tax years changed the seasonality of our business, making our revenue and operating results more difficult to predict. Any future regulatory decisions could further increase the difficulty of forecasting our revenue and operating results, which could cause our business to materially suffer.\n\u2022There are new and more frequent attempts by malicious third parties seeking to take advantage of the pandemic to fraudulently gain access to our systems, which could cause us to expend significant resources to remediate and could damage our reputation.\n\u2022Changes to our business operations and the operations of our third-party partners, such as increased use of videoconferencing, the shift to working from home, and the complexity of resuming operations in our offices under a new workplace model, has introduced security and execution risks that could cause us to experience substantial financial losses, lose the confidence of our customers and government agencies and harm our revenues and earnings.\n\u2022Potential disruption of services on which we rely to deliver our services to our customers, including our third-party customer success partners and financial institutions, could prevent us or our service providers from delivering critical services to our customers or accepting and fulfilling customer orders, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business or reputation.\n\u2022Increased, divergent and changing governmental regulations, such as those relating to the re-opening of work facilities, schools, public buildings and businesses, could make it considerably more difficult to develop, enhance and support our products and services, which may cause our results of operations and financial condition to suffer.\n\u2022Failure to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of our mergers and acquisitions activities for reasons related to the pandemic may cause us to experience losses that result in significant harm to our operating results or financial condition.\n\u2022There could be increased volatility in our stock price related to the pandemic, which could result in the loss of some or all of the value of an investment in Intuit.\nThese and other potential negative impacts relating to the COVID-19 pandemic are described further in the risk factors that follow.\nSTRATEGIC RISKS\nStrategic risks relate to our current and future operating model, business plans and growth strategy, including the risks associated with the following: competitive pressures on our product offerings and business models; our ability to adapt to technological changes and global trends; our reliance on third-party intellectual property and our ability to protect our own intellectual property rights; the value of our brand; and mergers, acquisitions and divestiture activity that may have unanticipated costs and expenses.\nWe face intense competitive pressures that may harm our operating results.\nWe face intense competition in all of our businesses, and we expect competition to remain intense in the future. Our competitors and potential competitors range from large and established entities to emerging start-ups. Our competitors may\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nintroduce superior products and services, reduce prices, have greater technical, marketing and other resources, have greater name recognition, have larger installed bases of customers, have well-established relationships with our current and potential customers, advertise aggressively or beat us to market with new products and services. In addition, we face competition from existing companies, with large established consumer user-bases and broad-based platforms, who may change or expand the focus of their business strategies and marketing to target our customers, including small businesses, tax and personal financial management customers.\nWe also face competition from companies with a variety of business models, including increased competition from providers of free offerings, particularly in our tax, accounting, payments and personal finance platform businesses. In order to compete, we have also introduced free offerings in several categories, but we may not be able to attract customers as effectively as competitors with different business models. In addition, other providers of free offerings may provide features that we do not offer and customers who have formerly paid for Intuit\u2019s products and services may elect to use our competitors\u2019 free offerings instead. These competitive factors may diminish our revenue and profitability, and harm our ability to acquire and retain customers.\nOur consumer tax business also faces significant potential competition from the public sector, where we face the risk of federal and state taxing authorities proposing revenue raising strategies that involve developing and providing government tax software or other government return preparation systems at public expense. These or similar programs may be introduced or expanded in the future, which may change the voluntary compliance tax system in ways that could cause us to lose customers and revenue. The IRS Free File Program is currently the sole means by which the IRS offers tax software directly to taxpayers and, in December 2019, the agreement governing the program was amended to eliminate the pledge by the IRS that it would not offer a duplicative or competing service. Under this program, the IRS has worked with private industry to provide more than 60 million free returns since 2003, utilizing donated private sector tax software and e-filing services, including software that we donated to the Free File Program, for low and middle income taxpayers at no cost to the government or individual users. However, we will no longer be participating in the IRS Free File Program, and its continuation depends on a number of factors, including continued broad public awareness of and access to the free program and continued private industry donations, as well as continued government support. The current agreement is scheduled to expire in October 2022. Our departure from the Free File Program may increase the likelihood that such program is terminated or is not extended beyond October 2022. If the Free File Program were to be terminated or the IRS were to enter the software development and return preparation space, the federal government could become a publicly funded direct competitor of the U.S. tax services industry and of Intuit. Government funded services that curtail or eliminate the role of taxpayers in preparing their own taxes could potentially have material and adverse revenue implications.\nFuture revenue growth depends upon our ability to adapt to technological change as well as global trends in the way customers access software offerings and successfully introduce new and enhanced products, services and business models.\nWe operate in industries that are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions. We must continue to innovate and develop new products and features to meet the changing needs of our customers and partners and attract and retain talented software developers. We need to continue to develop our skills, tools and capabilities to capitalize on existing and emerging technologies, which requires us to devote significant resources.\nOur consumer and professional tax businesses depend significantly on revenue from customers who return each year to use our updated tax preparation and filing software and services. As our existing products mature, encouraging customers to purchase product upgrades becomes more challenging unless new product releases provide features and functionality that have meaningful incremental value. We also provide additional customer benefits by utilizing customer data available to us through our existing offerings. If we are not able to develop and clearly demonstrate the value of new or upgraded products or services to our customers, or effectively utilize our customers\u2019 data to provide them with value, our revenues may be harmed. In addition, as we continue to introduce and expand our new business models, including offerings that are free to end users, our customers may not perceive value in the additional benefits and services we offer beyond our free offering and may choose not to pay for those additional benefits or we may be unsuccessful in increasing customer adoption of these offerings or our risk profile may change, resulting in loss of revenue.\nWe have devoted significant resources to develop products and services for users of mobile devices, but the versions of our products and services developed for these devices may not be compelling to users. Even if we are able to attract new users through these mobile offerings, the amount of revenue that we derive per user from mobile offerings may be less than the revenue that we have historically derived from users of personal computers. As new devices and new platforms are continually being released, it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in developing versions of our products and services for use on mobile devices and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation, support, and maintenance of such offerings. If we are slow to develop products and technologies that are compatible with mobile devices, or if our competitors are able to achieve those results more quickly than us, we will fail to capture a significant share of an increasingly important portion of the market for online services, which could adversely affect our business. Further, legislation or regulatory changes may mandate changes in our products that make them less attractive to users.\nIn some cases, we may expend a significant amount of resources and management attention on offerings that do not ultimately succeed in their markets. We have encountered difficulty in launching new products and services in the past. If we misjudge customer needs in the future, our new products and services may not succeed and our revenues and earnings may\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nbe harmed. We have also invested, and in the future, expect to invest in new business models, geographies, strategies and initiatives. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, expenses associated with the initiatives and inadequate return on investments. Because these new initiatives are inherently risky, they may not be successful and may harm our financial condition and operating results.\nWe rely on third-party intellectual property in our products and services.\nMany of our products and services include intellectual property of third parties, which we license under agreements that may need to be renewed or renegotiated from time to time. We may not be able to obtain licenses to these third-party technologies or content on reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain the rights necessary to use this intellectual property in our products and services, we may not be able to sell the affected offerings, and customers who are currently using the affected product may be disrupted, which may in turn harm our future financial results, damage our brand, and result in customer loss. Also, we and our customers have been and may continue to be subject to infringement claims as a result of the third-party intellectual property incorporated in our offerings. Although we try to mitigate this risk and we may not be ultimately liable for any potential infringement, pending claims require us to use significant resources, require management attention and could result in loss of customers.\nSome of our offerings include third-party software that is licensed under so-called \u201copen source\u201d licenses, some of which may include a requirement that, under certain circumstances, we make available, or grant licenses to, any modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software. Although we have established internal review and approval processes to mitigate these risks, we cannot be sure that all open source software is submitted for approval prior to use in our products. Many of the risks associated with usage of open source may not be eliminated, and may, if not properly addressed, harm our business.\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services and brand.\nOur patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, domain names and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. We aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common law rights in the U.S. and internationally, as well as a variety of administrative procedures. We also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights in products and services. The efforts that we take to protect our proprietary rights may not always be sufficient or effective. Protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming and may not be successful in every location. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business, our brand and our ability to compete.\nPolicing unauthorized use and copying of our products is difficult, expensive, and time consuming. Current U.S. laws that prohibit copying give us only limited practical protection from software piracy and the laws of many other countries provide very little protection. We frequently encounter unauthorized copies of our software being sold through online marketplaces. Although we continue to evaluate and put in place technology solutions to attempt to lessen the impact of piracy and engage in efforts to educate consumers and public policy leaders on these issues and cooperate with industry groups in their efforts to combat piracy, we expect piracy to be a persistent problem that results in lost revenues and increased expenses.\nOur business depends on our strong reputation and the value of our brands.\nDeveloping and maintaining awareness of our brands is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future products and services and is an important element in attracting new customers. Adverse publicity (whether or not justified) relating to events or activities attributed to us, members of our workforce, agents, third parties we rely on, or our users, may tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brands. Our brand value also depends on our ability to provide secure and trustworthy products and services as well as our ability to protect and use our customers\u2019 data in a manner that meets their expectations. In addition, a security incident that results in unauthorized disclosure of our customers\u2019 sensitive data could cause material reputational harm. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity may reduce demand for our products and services and thus have an adverse effect on our future financial results, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of the brands and could also reduce our stock price.\nOur acquisition and divestiture activities may disrupt our ongoing business, may involve increased expenses and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions.\nWe have acquired and may continue to acquire companies, products, technologies and talent that complement our strategic direction, both in and outside the United States. Acquisitions, such as our acquisition of Credit Karma, involve significant risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u2022inability to successfully integrate the acquired technology, data assets and operations into our business and maintain uniform standards, controls, policies, and procedures;\n\u2022inability to realize synergies expected to result from an acquisition;\n\u2022disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management;\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\n\u2022challenges retaining the key employees, customers, resellers and other business partners of the acquired operation;\n\u2022the internal control environment of an acquired entity may not be consistent with our standards or with regulatory requirements, and may require significant time and resources to align or rectify;\n\u2022unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence process, including product or service quality issues, intellectual property issues and legal contingencies;\n\u2022failure to successfully further develop an acquired business or technology and any resulting impairment of amounts currently capitalized as intangible assets;\n\u2022risks associated with businesses we acquire or invest in, which may differ from or be more significant than the risks our other businesses face;\n\u2022in the case of foreign acquisitions and investments, the impact of particular economic, tax, currency, political, legal and regulatory risks associated with specific countries; and\n\u2022to the extent we use debt to fund acquisitions or for other purposes, our interest expense and leverage will increase significantly, and to the extent we issue equity securities as consideration in an acquisition, current shareholders\u2019 percentage ownership and earnings per share will be diluted.\nWe have divested and may in the future divest certain assets or businesses that no longer fit with our strategic direction or growth targets. Divestitures involve significant risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u2022inability to find potential buyers on favorable terms;\n\u2022failure to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to buyers;\n\u2022requirements that we retain or indemnify buyers against certain liabilities and obligations;\n\u2022the possibility that we will become subject to third-party claims arising out of such divestiture;\n\u2022challenges in identifying and separating the intellectual property and data to be divested from the intellectual property and data that we wish to retain;\n\u2022inability to reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business;\n\u2022challenges in collecting the proceeds from any divestiture;\n\u2022disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management;\n\u2022loss of key employees who leave us as a result of a divestiture; and\n\u2022if customers or partners of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, our other businesses may be adversely affected, to the extent that these customers or partners also purchase other products offered by us or otherwise conduct business with our retained business.\nIn addition, any acquisition or divestiture that we announce may not be completed if closing conditions are not satisfied. Because acquisitions and divestitures are inherently risky, our transactions may not be successful and may, in some cases, harm our operating results or financial condition. In particular, if we are unable to successfully operate together with Credit Karma to achieve shared growth opportunities or combine reporting or other processes within the expected time frame, such delay may materially and adversely affect the benefits that we expect to achieve as a result of the Credit Karma acquisition and could result in additional costs or loss of revenue. Moreover, the impact of COVID-19, adverse changes in market conditions and other factors, such as the failure to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the Credit Karma acquisition, may cause the acquisition to be dilutive to Intuit\u2019s operating earnings per share beyond the first fiscal year after close. Any dilution of our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share could cause the price of shares of Intuit Common Stock to decline or grow at a reduced rate.\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nOperational risks arise from internal and external events relating to systems, processes and people. Risks that affect the operation of our businesses include the following: potential security incidents; privacy and cybersecurity concerns relating to online offerings; fraudulent activities by third parties; relationships with third parties; competition for and retention of key talent; issues with our product launches; problems with our information technology infrastructure; and risks associated with operating internationally.\nSecurity incidents, improper access to or disclosure of our data or customers\u2019 data, or other cyberattacks on our systems could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business.\nWe host, collect, use and retain large amounts of sensitive and personal customer and workforce data, including credit card information, tax return information, bank account numbers, credit report information, login credentials and passwords, personal and business financial data and transactions data, social security numbers and payroll information, as well as our confidential, nonpublic business information. We use commercially available security technologies and security and business\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\ncontrols to limit access to and use of such sensitive data. Although we expend significant resources to create security protections designed to shield this data against potential theft and security breaches, such measures cannot provide absolute security.\nOur technologies, systems, and networks have been subject to, and are increasingly likely to continue to be the target of, cyberattacks, computer viruses, ransomware or other malware, worms, social engineering, malicious software programs, insider threats, and other cybersecurity incidents that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, use, loss or destruction of sensitive and personal data of our customers and members of our workforce, or Intuit's sensitive business data or cause temporary or sustained unavailability of our software and systems. While we maintain cybersecurity insurance, our insurance may not be sufficient to cover all liabilities described herein. These types of incidents can be made by individuals, groups of hackers, and sophisticated organizations including state-sponsored organizations or nation-states themselves. Customers who fail to update their systems, continue to run software that we no longer support, fail to install security patches on a timely basis or inadequately use security controls create vulnerabilities and make it more difficult for us to detect and prevent these kinds of attacks. We are increasingly incorporating open source software into our products and there may be vulnerabilities in open source software that make it susceptible to cyberattacks. In addition, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive information change frequently, and are becoming more sophisticated and are often not able to be detected until after a successful attack, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. Although this is an industry-wide problem that affects software and hardware across platforms, it may increasingly affect our offerings because cyber-criminals tend to focus their efforts on well-known offerings that are popular among customers and hold sensitive information and we expect them to continue to do so.\nFurther, the security measures that we implement may not be able to prevent unauthorized access to our products and our customers\u2019 account data. While we provide resources like mandatory annual security training for our workforce, third parties may still be able to fraudulently induce members of our workforce, customers or users by social engineering means, such as email phishing, to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our systems. It is also possible that unauthorized access to or disclosure of customer data may occur due to inadequate use of security controls by our customers or members of our workforce. Accounts created with weak or recycled passwords could allow cyberattackers to gain access to customer data. Unauthorized persons could gain access to customer accounts if customers do not maintain effective access controls of their systems and software. In addition, we are experiencing new and more frequent attempts by third parties to use the COVID-19 pandemic to fraudulently gain access to our systems, such as through increased email phishing of our workforce.\nCriminals may also use stolen identity information obtained outside of our systems to gain unauthorized access to our customers\u2019 data. We have experienced such instances in the past and as the accessibility of stolen identity information increases, generally, we may experience further instances of unauthorized access to our systems through the use of stolen identity information of our customers or members of our workforce in the future. Further, our customers may choose to use the same login credentials across multiple products and services unrelated to our products. Such customers\u2019 login credentials may be stolen from products offered by third-party service providers unrelated to us and the stolen identity information may be used by a malicious third party to access our products, which could result in disclosure of confidential information. In addition, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we shifted nearly all our workforce from office locations to work from home environments. We expect to resume operations in our offices under a hybrid model where our workforce will spend a portion of their time working in our offices and a portion of their time working from home. This model increases our exposure to security-related risks due to operational changes, such as the increased use of videoconferencing.\nOur efforts to protect data may also be unsuccessful due to software bugs (whether open source or proprietary code), break-ins, workforce member error or other threats that evolve.\nFurther, because we have created an ecosystem where customers can have one identity across multiple Intuit products, a security incident may give access to increased amounts of customer data. This may result in disclosure of confidential information, loss of customer confidence in our products, possible litigation, material harm to our reputation and financial condition, disruption of our or our customers\u2019 business operations and a decline in our stock price. From time to time, we detect, or receive notices from customers or public or private agencies that they have detected, actual or perceived vulnerabilities in our servers, our software or third-party software components that are distributed with our products or fraudulent activity by unauthorized persons utilizing our products with stolen customer identity information. The existence of such vulnerabilities or fraudulent activity, even if they do not result in a security breach, may undermine customer confidence as well as the confidence of government agencies that regulate our offerings. Such perceived vulnerabilities could also seriously harm our business by tarnishing our reputation and brand and/or limiting the adoption of our products and services and could cause our stock price to decline.\nAdditionally, Credit Karma is subject to an order issued in 2014 by the Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\") that, among other things, requires maintenance of a comprehensive security program relating to the development and management of new and existing products and services and biannual independent security assessments for 20 years from the date of the order. To the extent Credit Karma shares data covered by the order with Intuit, the order may apply to Intuit with respect to such data. Credit Karma\u2019s failure to fulfill the requirements of the FTC\u2019s order could results in fines, penalties, regulatory inquiries, investigations and claims, and negatively impact our business and reputation.\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nA cybersecurity incident affecting the third parties we rely on could expose us or our customers to a risk of loss or misuse of confidential information and significantly damage our reputation.\nWe depend on a number of third parties, including vendors, developers and partners who are critical to our business. We or our customers may grant access to customer data to these third parties to help deliver customer benefits, or to host certain of our and our customers' sensitive and personal data. In addition, we share sensitive, nonpublic business information (including, for example, materials relating to financial, business and legal strategies) with other vendors in the ordinary course of business.\nWhile we conduct background checks of our workforce, conduct reviews of partners, developers and vendors and use commercially available technologies to limit access to systems and data, it is possible that one or more of these individuals or third parties may misrepresent their intended use of data or may circumvent our controls, resulting in accidental or intentional disclosure or misuse of our customer or workforce data. Further, while we conduct due diligence on these third parties with respect to their security and business controls, we may not have the ability to effectively monitor or oversee the implementation of these control measures. Individuals or third parties may be able to circumvent these security and business controls and/or exploit vulnerabilities that may exist in these controls, resulting in the disclosure or misuse of sensitive business and personal customer or workforce information and data. In addition, malicious actors may attempt to use the information technology supply chain to compromise our systems by, for example, introducing malware through software updates.\nA security incident involving third parties whom we rely on may have serious negative consequences for our businesses, including disclosure of sensitive customer or workforce data, or confidential or competitively sensitive information regarding our business, including intellectual property and other proprietary data; make our products more vulnerable to fraudulent activity; cause temporary or sustained unavailability of our software and systems; result in possible litigation, fines, penalties and damages; result in loss of customer confidence; cause material harm to our reputation and brands; lead to further regulation and oversight by federal or state agencies; cause adverse financial condition; and result in a reduced stock price.\nConcerns about the current privacy and cybersecurity environment, generally, could deter current and potential customers from adopting our products and services and damage our reputation.\nThe continued occurrence of cyberattacks and data breaches on governments, businesses and consumers in general indicates that we operate in an external environment where cyberattacks and data breaches are becoming increasingly common. If the global cybersecurity environment worsens, and there are increased instances of security breaches of third-party offerings where consumers\u2019 data and sensitive information is compromised, consumers may be less willing to use online offerings, particularly offerings like ours in which customers often share sensitive financial data. In addition, the increased availability of data obtained as a result of breaches of third-party offerings could make our own products more vulnerable to fraudulent activity. Even if our products are not affected directly by such incidents, any such incident could damage our reputation and deter current and potential customers from adopting our products and services or lead customers to cease using online and connected software products to transact financial business altogether.\nIf we are unable to effectively combat the increasing amount and sophistication of fraudulent activities by third parties using our offerings, we may suffer losses, which may be substantial, and lose the confidence of our customers and government agencies and our revenues and earnings may be harmed.\nThe online tax preparation, payroll administration, online payments, lending and personal financial management industries have been experiencing an increasing amount of fraudulent activities by third parties, and those fraudulent activities are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Although we do not believe that any of this activity is uniquely targeted at our products or businesses, this type of fraudulent activity may adversely impact our tax, payroll, payments, lending and personal financial management businesses and is heightened when our workforce is working from home. In addition to any losses that may result from such fraud, which may be substantial, a loss of confidence by our customers or by governmental agencies in our ability to prevent fraudulent activity that is perpetrated through our offerings may seriously harm our business and damage our brand. If we cannot adequately combat such fraudulent activity that is perpetrated through our offerings, governmental authorities may refuse to allow us to continue to offer such services, or these services may otherwise be adversely impacted, which could include federal or state tax authorities refusing to allow us to process our customers\u2019 tax returns electronically, resulting in a significant adverse impact on our earnings and revenue. As fraudulent activities become more pervasive and increasingly sophisticated, and fraud detection and prevention measures must become correspondingly more complex to combat them across the various industries in which we operate, we may implement risk control mechanisms that could make it more difficult for legitimate customers to obtain and use our products, which could result in lost revenue and negatively impact our earnings.\nIf we fail to process transactions effectively or fail to adequately protect against disputed or potential fraudulent activities, our business may be harmed.\nOur operations process a significant volume and dollar value of transactions on a daily basis, especially in our payroll, payments and personal financial management businesses. Despite our efforts to ensure that effective processing systems and controls are in place to handle transactions appropriately, it is possible that we may make errors or that funds may be misappropriated due to fraud. The likelihood of any such error or misappropriation may increase as we accelerate the speed at which we process transactions. The systems supporting our business are comprised of multiple technology platforms that are sometimes difficult to scale. If we are unable to effectively manage our systems and processes, or if there is an error in our products, we may be unable to process customer data in an accurate, reliable and timely manner, which may harm our\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nreputation, the willingness of customers to use our products, and our financial results. In our payments processing service business, if merchants for whom we process payment transactions are unable to pay refunds due to their customers in connection with disputed or fraudulent merchant transactions, we may be required to pay those amounts and our payments may exceed the amount of the customer reserves we have established to make such payments.\nBusiness interruption or failure of our information technology and communication systems may impair the availability of our products and services, which may damage our reputation and harm our future financial results.\nOur reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve our customers is dependent upon the reliable performance of our products and our underlying technical infrastructure. As we continue to grow our online services, we become more dependent on the continuing operation and availability of our information technology and communications systems and those of our external service providers, including, for example, third-party Internet-based or cloud computing services. We do not have redundancy for all of our systems, and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities. We have designed a significant portion of our software and computer systems to utilize data processing and storage capabilities provided by public cloud providers, such as Amazon Web Services. If any public cloud service that we use is unavailable to us for any reason, our customers may not be able to access certain of our cloud products or features, which could significantly impact our operations, business, and financial results.\nFailure of our systems or those of our third-party service providers, may result in interruptions in our service and loss of data or processing capabilities, all of which may cause a loss in customers, refunds of product fees, material harm to our reputation and operating results.\nOur tax businesses must effectively handle extremely heavy customer demand during critical peak periods, which typically occur from January until April of each year. We face significant risks in maintaining adequate service levels during these peak periods when we derive a substantial portion of our overall revenue from the tax businesses. Any interruptions in our online tax preparation or electronic filing service at any time during the tax season, particularly during a peak period, could result in significantly decreased revenue, lost customers, unexpected refunds of customer charges, negative publicity and increased operating costs, any of which could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on internal systems and external systems maintained by manufacturers, distributors and other service providers to take and fulfill customer orders, handle customer service requests and host certain online activities. Any interruption or failure of our internal or external systems may prevent us or our service providers from accepting and fulfilling customer orders or cause company and customer data to be unintentionally disclosed. Our continuing efforts to upgrade and expand our network security and other information systems as well as our high-availability capabilities are costly, and problems with the design or implementation of system enhancements may harm our business and our results of operations.\nOur business operations, information technology and communications systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, climate change, human error, malicious attacks, fire, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses and malware, computer denial of service attacks, terrorist attacks, public health emergencies and other events beyond our control. For example, we modified our business practices in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (including employee travel, employee work locations and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences) and we expect to resume operations in our offices under a hybrid model where our workforce will spend a portion of their time working in our offices and a portion of their time working from home. The implementation of this hybrid model will introduce new execution risks and we may experience longer-term disruptions to our operations as we evolve our workplace model. We may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers or third-party partners. We cannot predict how long any such measures will be in place and whether we would reimplement or enhance any such measures in one or more locations in order to respond to the effects of the pandemic or the rules, regulations or guidelines of any governmental authority. Any such measures may impair our ability to perform critical functions or could make it considerably more difficult to develop, enhance and support our products and services.\nIn addition, our corporate headquarters and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults. In the event of a major natural or man-made disaster, our insurance coverage may not completely compensate us for our losses and our future financial results may be materially harmed.\nWe regularly invest resources to update and improve our internal information technology systems and software platforms. Should our investments not succeed, or if delays or other issues with new or existing internal technology systems and software platforms disrupt our operations, our business could be harmed.\nWe rely on our network infrastructure, data hosting, public cloud and software-as-a-service providers, and internal technology systems for many of our development, marketing, operational, support, sales, accounting and financial reporting activities. We are continually investing resources to update and improve these systems and environments in order to meet existing needs, as well as the growing and changing requirements of our business and customers. If we experience prolonged delays or unforeseen difficulties in updating and upgrading our systems and architecture, we may experience outages and may not be able to deliver certain offerings and develop new offerings and enhancements that we need to remain competitive. Such improvements and upgrades are often complex, costly and time consuming. In addition, such improvements can be challenging to integrate with our existing technology systems, or may uncover problems with our existing technology systems.\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nUnsuccessful implementation of hardware or software updates and improvements could result in outages, disruption in our business operations, loss of revenue or damage to our reputation.\nIf we are unable to develop, manage and maintain critical third-party business relationships, our business may be adversely affected.\nOur growth is increasingly dependent on the strength of our business relationships and our ability to continue to develop, manage and maintain new and existing relationships with third-party partners. We rely on various third-party partners, including software and service providers, suppliers, credit reporting bureaus, vendors, manufacturers, distributors, accountants, contractors, financial institutions, core processors, licensing partners and development partners, among others, in many areas of our business in order to deliver our offerings and operate our business. Credit Karma generates revenue from its relationships with financial institution partners, which are subject to particular risks that affect their willingness to offer their products on Credit Karma's platform, such as adverse economic conditions and an increasing complexity in the regulatory environment. We also rely on third parties to support the operation of our business by maintaining our physical facilities, equipment, power systems and infrastructure. In certain instances, these third-party relationships are sole source or limited source relationships and can be difficult to replace or substitute depending on the level of integration of the third party\u2019s products or services into, or with, our offerings and/or the general availability of such third party\u2019s products and services. In addition, there may be few or no alternative third-party providers or vendors in the market. Further, there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately retain third-party contractors engaged to help us operate our business.\nAdditionally, the business operations of our third-party partners have been and could continue to be disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken in response to it, including the pandemic\u2019s effects on their third-party partners. If our third-party partners are unable to help us operate our business as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our business and financial results may be negatively impacted. For example, in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, credit card companies and lenders initially and temporarily reduced or suspended their activity on Credit Karma\u2019s platform, which impacted Credit Karma\u2019s revenue. The failure of third parties to provide acceptable and high quality products, services and technologies or to update their products, services and technologies may result in a disruption to our business operations and our customers, which may reduce our revenues and profits, cause us to lose customers and damage our reputation. Alternative arrangements and services may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or we may experience business interruptions upon a transition to an alternative partner.\nAlthough we have strict standards for our suppliers and business partners to comply with the law and company policies regarding workplace and employment practices, data use and security, environmental compliance, intellectual property licensing and other applicable regulatory and compliance requirements, we cannot control their day-to-day practices. Any violation of laws or implementation of practices regarded as unethical could result in supply chain disruptions, canceled orders, terminations of or damage to key relationships, and damage to our reputation.\nIn particular, we have relationships with banks, credit unions and other financial institutions that support certain critical services we offer to our customers. If macroeconomic conditions or other factors, including the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, cause any of these institutions to fail, consolidate, stop providing certain services or institute cost-cutting efforts, our business and financial results may suffer and we may be unable to offer those services to our customers.\nWe increasingly utilize the distribution platforms of third parties like Apple\u2019s App Store and Google\u2019s Play Store for the distribution of certain of our product offerings. Although we benefit from the strong brand recognition and large user base of these distribution platforms to attract new customers, the platform owners have wide discretion to change the pricing structure, terms of service and other policies with respect to us and other developers. Any adverse changes by these third parties could adversely affect our financial results.\nBecause competition for our key employees is intense, we may not be able to attract, retain and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our planned growth.\nMuch of our future success depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel, including members of our executive team, and those in technical and other key positions. Experienced personnel in the software, mobile technologies, data science, data security, and software as a service industries are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in California and India, where a significant number of our employees are located. Also, as we strive to continue to adapt to technological change and introduce new and enhanced products and business models, we must be able to secure, maintain and develop the right quality and quantity of engaged and committed talent. The incentives we have available to attract, retain, and motivate employees provided by our equity awards may become less effective, and if we were to issue significant equity to attract additional employees, the ownership of our existing stockholders would be diluted. Although we strive to be an employer of choice, we may not be able to continue to successfully attract, retain and develop key personnel, which may cause our business to suffer. Moreover, as social and economic conditions evolve from the COVID-19 pandemic, current and prospective employees may seek new or different opportunities based on factors such as compensation, benefits, mobility and flexibility that are different from what we offer, making it difficult to attract and retain them.\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nIf we experience significant product accuracy or quality problems or delays in product launches, it may harm our revenue, earnings and reputation.\nAll of our tax products and many of our non-tax products have rigid development timetables that increase the risk of errors in our products and the risk of launch delays. Our tax preparation software product development cycle is particularly challenging due to the need to incorporate unpredictable and potentially late tax law and tax form changes each year and because our customers expect high levels of accuracy and a timely launch of these products to prepare and file their taxes by the tax filing deadline. Due to the complexity of our products and the condensed development cycles under which we operate, our products may contain errors that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the software or result in incorrect calculations. The complexity of the tax laws on which our products are based may also make it difficult for us to consistently deliver offerings that contain the features, functionality and level of accuracy that our customers expect. When we encounter problems we may be required to modify our code, work with state tax administrators to communicate with affected customers, assist customers with amendments, distribute patches to customers who have already purchased the product and recall or repackage existing product inventory in our distribution channels. If we encounter development challenges or discover errors in our products either late in our development cycle or after release it may cause us to delay our product launch date or suspend product availability until such issues can be fixed. Any major defects, launch delays or product suspensions may lead to loss of customers and revenue, negative publicity, customer and employee dissatisfaction, reduced retailer shelf space and promotions, and increased operating expenses, such as inventory replacement costs, legal fees or other payments, including those resulting from our accuracy guarantee in our tax preparation products. For example, an error in our tax products could cause a compliance error for taxpayers, including the over or underpayment of their federal or state tax liability. While our accuracy guarantee commits us to reimburse penalties and interest paid by customers due solely to calculation errors in our tax preparation products, such errors may result in additional burdens on third parties that we may need to address or that may cause us to suspend the availability of our products until such errors are addressed. This could also affect our reputation, the willingness of customers to use our products, and our financial results. Further, as we develop our platform to connect people to experts, such as connecting TurboTax customers with tax experts through our TurboTax Live offering, or connecting QuickBooks customers with bookkeepers through our QuickBooks Live offering, we face the risk that these experts may provide advice that is erroneous, ineffective or otherwise unsuitable. Any such deficiency in the advice given by these experts may cause harm to our customers, a loss of customer confidence in our offerings or harm to our reputation or financial results.\nOur international operations are subject to increased risks which may harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nIn addition to uncertainty about our ability to generate revenues from our foreign operations and expand into international markets, there are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:\n\u2022different or more restrictive privacy, data protection, data localization, and other laws that could require us to make changes to our products, services and operations, such as mandating that certain types of data collected in a particular country be stored and/or processed within that country;\n\u2022difficulties in developing, staffing, and simultaneously managing a large number of varying foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences;\n\u2022stringent local labor laws and regulations;\n\u2022credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;\n\u2022profit repatriation restrictions, and foreign currency exchange restrictions;\n\u2022geopolitical events, including natural disasters, acts of war and terrorism, and public health emergencies, including divergent governmental responses thereto across the jurisdictions in which we operate;\n\u2022import or export regulations;\n\u2022compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and laws and regulations of other jurisdictions prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials and other third parties;\n\u2022antitrust and competition regulations;\n\u2022potentially adverse tax developments;\n\u2022economic uncertainties relating to European sovereign and other debt;\n\u2022trade barriers and changes in trade regulations;\n\u2022political or social unrest, economic instability, repression, or human rights issues; and\n\u2022risks related to other government regulation or required compliance with local laws.\nViolations of the rapidly evolving and complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations may result in fines, criminal actions or sanctions against us, our officers or our broader workforce, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws, we cannot be sure that our workforce, contractors and agents are in compliance with our policies.\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nThese risks inherent in our international operations and expansion increase our costs of doing business internationally and may result in harm to our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nLEGAL AND COMPLIANCE RISKS\nLegal and compliance risks arise from change in the government and regulatory environment, including complex and evolving regulations relating to privacy and data security; potential litigation; regulatory inquiries and intellectual property infringement claims.\nIncreased government regulation of our businesses, or changes to existing regulations, may harm our operating results.\nThe Company is subject to federal, state, local and international laws and regulations that affect the Company\u2019s activities, including, without limitation, areas of labor, advertising, tax, financial services, data privacy and security, electronic funds transfer, money transmission, lending, digital content, consumer protection, real estate, billing, e-commerce, promotions, quality of services, intellectual property ownership and infringement, import and export requirements, anti-corruption, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, anti-competition, environmental, health and safety, and other regulated activities. There have been significant new regulations and heightened focus by the government on many of these areas, as well as in areas such as insurance and privacy. As we expand our products and services and revise our business models, both domestically and internationally, we may become subject to additional government regulation or increased regulatory scrutiny. For example, in April 2020, one of our subsidiaries became a Small Business Administration (\"SBA\") approved lender under the SBA\u2019s recently established Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d) authorized by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act. Further, regulators (both in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions in which we operate) may adopt new laws or regulations, change existing regulations, or their interpretation of existing laws or regulations may differ from ours. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, federal, state, local and foreign governmental authorities have imposed, and may continue to impose, protocols and restrictions intended to contain the spread of the virus, including limitations on the reopening of work facilities, schools, public buildings and businesses, quarantines, lockdowns and travel restrictions. Such restrictions have disrupted and may continue to disrupt our business operations and limit our ability to perform critical functions.\nThe tax preparation industry continues to receive heightened attention from federal and state governments. New legislation, regulation, public policy considerations, changes in the cybersecurity environment, litigation by the government or private entities, changes to or new interpretations of existing laws may result in greater oversight of the tax preparation industry, restrict the types of products and services that we can offer or the prices we can charge, or otherwise cause us to change the way we operate our tax businesses or offer our tax products and services. We may not be able to respond quickly to such regulatory, legislative and other developments, and these changes may in turn increase our cost of doing business and limit our revenue opportunities. In addition, if our practices are not consistent with new interpretations of existing laws, we may become subject to lawsuits, penalties, and other liabilities that did not previously apply. We are also required to comply with a variety of state revenue agency standards in order to successfully operate our tax preparation and electronic filing services.\nChanges in state-imposed requirements by one or more of the states, including the required use of specific technologies or technology standards, may significantly increase the costs of providing those services to our customers and may prevent us from delivering a quality product to our customers in a timely manner.\nComplex and evolving U.S. and international laws and regulation regarding privacy and data protection could result in claims, changes to our business practices, penalties or increased cost of operations or otherwise harm our business.\nRegulations related to the provision of online services is evolving as federal, state and foreign governments continue to adopt new or modify existing laws and regulations addressing data privacy and the collection, processing, storage, transfer and use of data. This includes, for example, the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, the California Consumer Protection Act, the California Privacy Rights Act, and the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, which will become effective in January 2023. In our efforts to meet the GDPR, CCPA and other data privacy regulations, we have made and continue to make certain operational changes to our products and business practices. If we are unable to engineer products that meet these evolving requirements or help our customers meet their obligations under these or other new data regulations, we might experience reduced demand for our offerings. Further, penalties for non-compliance with these laws may be significant.\nIn addition, the evolution of global privacy treaties and frameworks has created compliance uncertainty and increased complexity. For example, the judicial invalidation of the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks that we relied on to transfer data has created additional compliance challenges for the transfer of EU personal data to the U.S. While we rely on alternative methods for the transfer of this data, ongoing legal challenges to these and other transfer mechanisms could cause us to incur costs or change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.\nOther governmental authorities throughout the U.S. and around the world are considering similar types of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. Each of these privacy, security and data protection laws and regulations could impose significant limitations, require changes to our business, require notification to customers or workers of a security breach, restrict our use or storage of personal information, or cause changes in customer purchasing behavior which may make our business more costly, less efficient or impossible to conduct, and may require us to modify our current or future products\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nor services, which may make customers less likely to purchase our products and may harm our future financial results. Additionally, any actual or alleged noncompliance with these laws and regulations could result in negative publicity and subject us to investigations, claims or other remedies, including demands that we modify or cease existing business practices, and expose us to significant fines, penalties and other damages. We have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenses to comply with existing privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards or contractual obligations.\nWe are frequently a party to litigation and regulatory inquiries which could result in an unfavorable outcome and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.\nWe are subject to various legal proceedings (including class action lawsuits), claims and regulatory inquiries that have arisen out of the ordinary conduct of our business and are not yet resolved and additional claims and inquiries may arise in the future. The number and significance of these claims and inquiries may increase as our businesses evolve. Any proceedings, claims or inquiries initiated by or against us, whether successful or not, may be time consuming; result in costly litigation, damage awards, consent decrees, injunctive relief or increased costs of business; require us to change our business practices or products; require significant amounts of management time; result in diversion of significant operations resources; or otherwise harm our business and future financial results. For further information about specific litigation, see Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d\nThird parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights may cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our products.\nWe may become increasingly subject to infringement claims, including patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement claims. Litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of the intellectual property rights of others. We have received a number of allegations of intellectual property infringement claims in the past and expect to receive more claims in the future based on allegations that our offerings infringe upon the intellectual property held by third parties. Some of these claims are the subject of pending litigation against us and against some of our customers. These claims may involve patent holding companies or other adverse intellectual property owners who have no relevant product revenues of their own, and against whom our own intellectual property may provide little or no deterrence. The ultimate outcome of any allegation is uncertain and, regardless of outcome, any such claim, with or without merit, may be time consuming to defend, result in costly litigation, divert management\u2019s time and attention from our business, require us to stop selling, delay shipping or redesign our products, or require us to pay monetary damages for royalty or licensing fees, or to satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers. Our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights, or litigation arising out of intellectual property claims may harm our business.\nWe are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our services.\nThe laws relating to the liability of online services companies for information such as online content disseminated through their services are subject to frequent challenges. In spite of settled law in the U.S., claims are made against online services companies by parties who disagree with the content. Where our online content is accessed on the internet outside of the U.S., challenges may be brought under foreign laws which do not provide the same protections for online services companies as in the U.S. These challenges in either U.S. or foreign jurisdictions may give rise to legal claims alleging defamation, libel, invasion of privacy, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through the services. Certain of our services include content generated by users of our online services. Although this content is not generated by us, claims of defamation or other injury may be made against us for that content. Any costs incurred as a result of this potential liability may harm our business.\nFINANCIAL RISKS\nFinancial risks relate to our ability to meet financial obligations and mitigate exposure to financial impacts to our businesses or our offerings. Financial risks arise from the following: seasonality; excessive subscription cancellations and product returns; unanticipated changes in income tax rates; adverse global macro-economic conditions; credit risks; fluctuations in our net income; indebtedness; and the fluctuation of our stock price.\nOur tax business is highly seasonal and our quarterly results fluctuate significantly.\nOur tax offerings have significant seasonal patterns. Revenue from income tax preparation products and services has historically been heavily concentrated from November through April and this seasonality has been affected by changes to the opening and closing dates of the tax season. For example, the IRS and many states extended their tax filing deadlines to May 17, 2021 for the 2020 tax year and to July 15, 2020 for the 2019 tax year. This seasonality has caused significant fluctuations in our quarterly financial results. Our financial results may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a variety of factors, including factors that may affect the timing of revenue recognition. These include the timing of the availability of federal and state tax forms from taxing agencies and the ability of those agencies to receive electronic tax return submissions; changes to our offerings that result in the inclusion or exclusion of ongoing services; changes in product pricing strategies or product sales mix; changes in customer behavior; and the timing of our discontinuation of support for older product offerings. Other factors that may affect our quarterly or annual financial results include the timing of acquisitions, divestitures, and\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\ngoodwill and acquired intangible asset impairment charges. Any fluctuations in our operating results may adversely affect our stock price.\nIf actual customer refunds for our offerings exceed the amount we have reserved our future financial results may be harmed.\nLike many software companies we refund customers for product returns and subscription cancellations. We establish reserves against revenue in our financial statements based on estimated customer refunds. We closely monitor this refund activity in an effort to maintain adequate reserves. In the past, customer refunds have not differed significantly from these reserves. However, if we experience actual customer refunds or an increase in risks of collecting customer payments that significantly exceed the amount we have reserved, it may result in lower net revenue.\nUnanticipated changes in our income tax rates or other indirect tax may affect our future financial results.\nOur future effective income tax rates may be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, by changes in our stock price, or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation. There are several pending proposed changes to U.S. and non-U.S. tax legislation and the ultimate enactment of any of them could have a negative impact on our effective tax rate. Foreign governments may enact tax laws that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. These continuous examinations may result in unforeseen tax-related liabilities, which may harm our future financial results.\nAn increasing number of states and foreign jurisdictions have adopted laws or administrative practices, that impose new taxes on all or a portion of gross revenue or other similar amounts or impose additional obligations to collect transaction taxes such as sales, consumption, value added, or similar taxes. We may not have sufficient lead time to build systems and processes to collect these taxes properly, or at all. Failure to comply with such laws or administrative practices, or a successful assertion by such states or foreign jurisdictions requiring us to collect taxes where we do not, could result in material tax liabilities, including for past sales, as well as penalties and interest.\nAdverse global economic conditions could harm our business and financial condition.\nAdverse macroeconomic developments could negatively affect our business and financial condition. Adverse global economic events have caused, and could, in the future, cause disruptions and volatility in global financial markets and increased rates of default and bankruptcy, and could impact consumer and small business spending. In particular, because the majority of our revenue is derived from sales within the U.S., economic conditions in the U.S. have an even greater impact on us than companies with a more diverse international presence. Challenging economic times could cause potential new customers not to purchase or to delay purchasing our products and services, and could cause our existing customers to discontinue purchasing or delay upgrades of our existing products and services. In addition, financial institution partners may again decrease or suspend their activity on Credit Karma\u2019s platform, Credit Karma\u2019s members may decrease their engagement on the platform or their creditworthiness could be negatively impacted, reducing members' ability to qualify for credit cards and loans. Any of the foregoing may negatively impact our revenues and future financial results. Decreased consumer spending levels could also reduce credit and debit card transaction processing volumes causing reductions in our payments revenue. Poor economic conditions and high unemployment have caused, and could in the future cause, a significant decrease in the number of tax returns filed, which may have a significant effect on the number of tax returns we prepare and file. In addition, weakness in the end-user consumer and small business markets could negatively affect the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who could, in turn, delay paying their obligations to us, which could increase our credit risk exposure and cause delays in our recognition of revenue or future sales to these customers. Any of these events could harm our business and our future financial results.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken in response to it have significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty. Accordingly, the risks described in the paragraph above may be more likely to materialize, any of which could harm our business and our future financial results.\nWe provide capital to small businesses, which exposes us to certain risk, and may cause us material financial or reputational harm.\nWe provide capital to qualified small businesses, which exposes us to the risk of our borrowers\u2019 inability to repay such loans. We have also entered into credit arrangements with financial institutions to obtain the capital we provide under this offering. Any termination or interruption in the financial institutions\u2019 ability to lend to us could interrupt our ability to provide capital to qualified small businesses. Further, our credit decisioning, pricing, loss forecasting, scoring and other models used to evaluate loan applications may contain errors or may not adequately assess creditworthiness of our borrowers, or may be otherwise ineffective, resulting in incorrect approvals or denials of loans. It is also possible that loan applicants could provide false or incorrect information. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken in response to it have had a significant impact on small businesses and may increase the likelihood that our borrowers are unable to repay their loans. If any of the foregoing events were to occur, our reputation, relationships with borrowers, collections of loans receivable and financial results could be harmed. In addition, one of our subsidiaries is a lender and a servicer under the PPP to support our small business customers and other eligible applicants during the pandemic. Our participation in this program exposes us to many of the risks described\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nabove and additional risks, such as borrower default, the SBA declining to forgive or honor its guarantee with respect to PPP loans and litigation or other disputes with borrowers or others related to our PPP activities.\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets and impairment charges may cause significant fluctuation in our net income.\nOur acquisitions have resulted in significant expenses, including amortization and impairment of acquired technology and other acquired intangible assets, and impairment of goodwill. Total costs and expenses in these categories were $196 million in fiscal 2021; $28 million in fiscal 2020; and $26 million in fiscal 2019. Although under current accounting rules goodwill is not amortized, we may incur impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded and to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions. We test the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise. The timing of the formal annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that may not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods. At July 31, 2021, we had $5.6 billion in goodwill and $3.3 billion in net acquired intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet, both of which may be subject to impairment charges in the future. New acquisitions, and any impairment of the value of acquired intangible assets, may have a significant negative impact on our future financial results.\nWe have incurred indebtedness and may incur other debt in the future, which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results.\nAs of July 31, 2021, we had an aggregate of $2.0 billion of indebtedness outstanding under our credit facilities and our senior unsecured notes. Under the agreements governing our indebtedness, we are permitted to incur additional debt. This debt, and any debt that we may incur in the future, may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results by, among other things:\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business, to competitive pressures and to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022requiring the dedication of a portion of our expected cash from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures, share repurchases and acquisitions; and\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and our industries.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt, we may be required, among other things, to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets, refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness, sell selected assets or reduce or delay planned capital, operating or investment expenditures. Such measures may not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt.\nAdditionally, the agreements governing our indebtedness impose restrictions on us and require us to comply with certain covenants. For example, our credit facilities restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness and require us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control. In addition, our credit facilities and the indenture governing our senior unsecured notes limit our ability to create liens our and subsidiaries\u2019 assets and engage in sale and leaseback transactions. If we breach any of these covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders or the noteholders, as applicable, then, subject to applicable cure periods, any or all of our outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable. There can be no assurance that any refinancing or additional financing would be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us, if at all.\nUnder the terms of our outstanding senior unsecured notes, we may be required to repurchase the notes for cash prior to their maturity in connection with the occurrence of certain changes of control that are accompanied by certain downgrades in the credit ratings of the notes. The repayment obligations under the notes may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a takeover of our company. If we were required to pay the notes prior to their scheduled maturity, it could have a negative impact on our cash position and liquidity and impair our ability to invest financial resources in other strategic initiatives.\nIn addition, changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities. If our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, the interest rate payable by us under our unsecured revolving credit facility may increase. In addition, any downgrades in our credit ratings may affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and may negatively impact the terms of any such financing.\nWe cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value.\nWe have a stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase our common stock. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date and we are not obligated to repurchase a specified number or dollar value of shares. Our repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time. Even if our stock repurchase program is fully implemented, it may not enhance long-term stockholder value. Also, the amount, timing, and execution of our stock repurchase programs may fluctuate based on our priorities for the use of cash for other purposes and because of changes in cash flows, tax laws, and the market price of our common stock.\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nOur stock price may be volatile and your investment could lose value.\nOur stock price is subject to changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by financial analysts, changes in investors\u2019 or analysts\u2019 valuation measures for our stock, our credit ratings and market trends unrelated to our performance. Furthermore, speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position, financial condition, results of operations, business or security of our products, can cause changes in our stock price. These factors, as well as general economic and political conditions, including the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the timing of announcements in the public market regarding new products, product enhancements or technological advances by our competitors or us, and any announcements by us of acquisitions, major transactions, or management changes may adversely affect our stock price. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant volatility in the global financial markets, which has resulted in significant volatility in our stock price recently. Further, any changes in the amounts or frequency of share repurchases or dividends may also adversely affect our stock price. A significant drop in our stock price could expose us to the risk of securities class actions lawsuits, which may result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which may adversely affect our business.",

    "item_7": "ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to provide readers of our consolidated financial statements with the perspectives of management. This should allow the readers of this report to obtain a comprehensive understanding of our businesses, strategies, current trends, and future prospects. Our MD&A includes the following sections:\n\u2022 Executive Overview: High level discussion of our operating results and some of the trends that affect our business.\n\u2022 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates: Policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments underlying our financial statements.\n\u2022 Results of Operations: A more detailed discussion of our revenue and expenses.\n\u2022 Liquidity and Capital Resources: Discussion of key aspects of our consolidated statements of cash flows, changes in our consolidated balance sheets, and our financial commitments.\nYou should note that this MD&A contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Please see the section entitled \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d immediately preceding Part I for important information to consider when evaluating such statements.\nYou should read this MD&A in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic we continue to conduct business with substantial modifications to employee work locations and employee travel, among other modifications. In June 2021 a small number of employees started returning to work locations on a limited basis. While we have not experienced significant disruptions to our operations from the COVID-19 pandemic, we are unable to predict the full impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our operations and future financial performance, including demand for our offerings, impact to our customers and partners, actions that may be taken by governmental authorities, and other factors identified in \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Item 1A of Part I of this Report.\nIn April 2020, Intuit was approved as a non-bank Small Business Administration lender for the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). The PPP was authorized under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) to provide small businesses loans to pay payroll and group health costs, salaries and commissions, mortgage and rent payments, utilities, and interest on other debt which is designed to provide assistance to small businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn August 2020, we reorganized certain technology and customer success functions that support and benefit our overall platform. Additionally, certain legal, facility and employee service costs are now managed at the corporate level. As a result, these costs are no longer included in segment operating income and are now included in other corporate expenses. For the twelve months ended July 31, 2020 and 2019, we reclassified $180 million and $172 million from Small Business & Self-Employed, $121 million and $78 million from Consumer, and $13 million and $12 million from ProConnect to other corporate expenses. In August 2020, we also renamed our Strategic Partner segment as the ProConnect segment. This segment continues to serve professional accountants.\nIn fiscal 2021 we acquired Credit Karma. We have included their results of operations in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition. Credit Karma operates as a separate reportable segment. Segment operating income for Credit Karma includes all direct expenses related to selling and marketing, product development, and general and administrative, which is different from our other reportable segments. See Note 6 in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nThis overview provides a high level discussion of our operating results and some of the trends that affect our business. We believe that an understanding of these trends is important in order to understand our financial results for fiscal 2021 as well as our future prospects. This summary is not intended to be exhaustive, nor is it a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIndustry Trends and Seasonality\nIndustry Trends\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming multiple industries, including financial technology. Disruptive start-ups, emerging ecosystems and mega-platforms are harnessing new technology to create personalized experiences, deliver data-driven insights and increase speed of service. These shifts are creating a more dynamic and highly competitive environment where customer expectations are shifting around the world as more services become digitized and the array of choices continues to increase.\nIntuit Fiscal 2018 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nSeasonality\nOur Consumer and ProConnect offerings have a significant and distinct seasonal pattern as sales and revenue from our income tax preparation products and services are typically concentrated in the period from November through April. This seasonal pattern typically results in higher net revenues during our second and third quarters ending January 31 and April 30, respectively.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the timing of tax filing seasons for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 varied significantly. In fiscal 2019, the IRS began accepting returns on January 28, 2019 and the tax filing deadline was April 15, 2019. In fiscal 2020, the IRS began accepting returns on January 27, 2020 and the tax filing deadline was July 15, 2020. In fiscal 2021, the IRS began accepting returns on February 12, 2021 and the tax filing deadline was May 17, 2021. These changes to the tax filing seasons impacted our quarterly financial results during fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020.\nWe expect the seasonality of our Consumer and ProConnect businesses to continue to have a significant impact on our quarterly financial results in the future.\nKey Challenges and Risks\nOur growth strategy depends upon our ability to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, to enter new markets, and to drive broad adoption of the products and services we develop and market. Our future growth also increasingly depends on the strength of our third-party business relationships and our ability to continue to develop, maintain, and strengthen new and existing relationships. To remain competitive and continue to grow, we are investing significant resources in our product development, marketing, and sales capabilities, and we expect to continue to do so in the future.\nAs we offer more online services, the ongoing operation and availability of our platforms and systems and those of our external service providers is becoming increasingly important. Because we help customers manage their financial lives, we face risks associated with the hosting, collection, use, and retention of personal customer information and data. We are investing significant management attention and resources in our information technology infrastructure and in our privacy and security capabilities, and we expect to continue to do so in the future.\nFor our consumer and professional tax offerings, we have implemented additional security measures and are continuing to work with state and federal governments to implement industry-wide security and anti-fraud measures, including sharing information regarding suspicious filings. We received ISO 27001 certification for a portion of our systems and we continue to invest in security measures and to work with the broader industry and government to protect our customers against this type of fraud. Additionally, Credit Karma\u2019s security measures are regularly reviewed and updated.\nFor a complete discussion of the most significant risks and uncertainties affecting our business, please see \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d immediately preceding Part I and \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Item 1A of Part I of this Report\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nOverview of Financial Results\nThe most important financial indicators that we use to assess our business are revenue growth for the company as a whole and for each reportable segment; operating income growth for the company as a whole; earnings per share; and cash flow from operations. We also track certain non-financial drivers of revenue growth and, when material, identify them in the applicable discussions of segment results below. Service offerings are a significant part of our business. Our total service and other revenue was $7.9 billion or 82% of our total revenue in fiscal 2021 and we expect our total service and other revenue to continue to grow in the future.\nKey highlights for fiscal 2021 include the following:\nRevenue of Small Business & Self-Employed revenue of Consumer revenue of\n$9.6 B $4.7 B $3.6 B\nup 25% from fiscal 2020 up 16% from fiscal 2020 up 14% from fiscal 2020\nOperating income of Net income of Diluted net income per share of\n$2.5 B $2.1 B $7.56\nup 15% from fiscal 2020 up 13% from fiscal 2020 up 9% from fiscal 2020\nWe ended fiscal 2021 with cash, cash equivalents and investments totaling $3.9 billion.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nIn preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we are required to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue, operating income or loss and net income or loss, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We believe that the estimates, assumptions, and judgments involved in the following accounting policies have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies:\n\u2022Revenue Recognition\n\u2022Business Combinations\n\u2022Goodwill, Acquired Intangible Assets, and Other Long-Lived Assets - Impairment Assessments\n\u2022Legal Contingencies\n\u2022Accounting for Income Taxes - Estimates of Deferred Taxes, Valuation Allowances, and Uncertain Tax Positions\nOur senior management has reviewed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and their disclosure in this Annual Report on Form 10-K with the Audit and Risk Committee of our Board of Directors.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue primarily from the sale of online services such as tax, accounting, payroll, merchant payment processing, delivery of qualified links and packaged desktop software products and desktop software subscriptions. Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services. In determining how revenue should be recognized, a five-step process is used, which requires judgment and estimates within the revenue recognition process. The primary judgments include identifying the performance obligations in the contract and determining whether the performance obligations are distinct. If any of these judgments were to change it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nof revenue we report in a particular period. For additional information, see \u201cRevenue Recognition\u201d in Note 1 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nBusiness Combinations\nAs described in \u201cDescription of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Business Combinations,\u201d in Note 1 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report, under the acquisition method of accounting we generally recognize the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interests in an acquiree at their fair values as of the date of acquisition. We measure goodwill as the excess of consideration transferred, which we also measure at fair value, over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The acquisition method of accounting requires us to exercise judgment and make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair values of the elements of a business combination as of the date of acquisition, including the fair values of identifiable intangible assets, deferred tax asset valuation allowances, liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, and contingencies. This method also requires us to refine these estimates over a one-year measurement period to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. If we are required to retroactively adjust provisional amounts that we have recorded for the fair values of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions, these adjustments could materially decrease our operating income and net income and result in lower asset values on our consolidated balance sheet.\nSignificant estimates and assumptions that we must make in estimating the fair value of acquired technology, customer lists, and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets. If the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, we could record impairment charges. In addition, we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense. If our estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed.\nGoodwill, Acquired Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets - Impairment Assessments\nWe estimate the fair value of acquired intangible assets and other long-lived assets that have finite useful lives whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. We test for potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or whenever indicators of impairment arise. The timing of the annual test may result in charges to our consolidated statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods.\nAs described in \u201cDescription of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Goodwill, Acquired Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets,\u201d in Note 1 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report, in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill we use a weighted combination of a discounted cash flow model (known as the income approach) and comparisons to publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses (known as the market approach). The income approach requires us to use a number of assumptions, including market factors specific to the business, the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the business over an extended period of time, long-term growth rates for the business, and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money. We evaluate cash flows at the reporting unit level. Although the assumptions we use in our discounted cash flow model are consistent with the assumptions we use to generate our internal strategic plans and forecasts, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows from each reporting unit and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows. When using the market approach, we make judgments about the comparability of publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses. We base our judgments on factors such as size, growth rates, profitability, risk, and return on investment. We also make judgments when adjusting market multiples of revenue, operating income, and earnings for these companies to reflect their relative similarity to our own businesses. See Note 5 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for a summary of goodwill by reportable segment.\nWe estimate the recoverability of acquired intangible assets and other long-lived assets that have finite useful lives by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that we expect the asset to generate. In order to estimate the fair value of those assets, we estimate the present value of future cash flows from those assets. The key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model are the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset over an extended period of time and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money. Significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows. We also make judgments about the remaining useful lives of acquired intangible assets and other long-lived assets that have finite lives. See Note 5 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for a summary of cost, accumulated amortization and weighted average life in years for our acquired intangible assets.\nAssumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. For example, if our future operating results do not meet current forecasts or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization that is determined to be indicative of a reduction in fair value of one or more of our reporting units, we may be required to record future impairment charges for goodwill and\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nacquired intangible assets. Impairment charges could materially decrease our future net income and result in lower asset values on our consolidated balance sheet.\nDuring the fourth quarters of fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020, and fiscal 2019 we performed our annual goodwill impairment tests. Using the methodology described in \u201cDescription of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Goodwill, Acquired Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets,\u201d in Note 1 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report, we determined that the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and that they were not impaired. In addition, during this analysis we concluded that the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values.\nLegal Contingencies\nWe are subject to certain legal proceedings, as well as demands, claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business. We review the status of each significant matter quarterly and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability and an expense for the estimated loss. If we determine that a loss is possible and the range of the loss can be reasonably determined, then we disclose the range of the possible loss. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether a potential loss is probable, reasonably possible, or remote as well as in the determination of whether a potential exposure is reasonably estimable. Our accruals are based on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Potential legal liabilities and the revision of estimates of potential legal liabilities could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. See Note 13 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information.\nAccounting for Income Taxes - Estimates of Deferred Taxes, Valuation Allowances, and Uncertain Tax Positions\nWe estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the United States Internal Revenue Service or other taxing jurisdictions. We estimate our current tax liability and assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which we show on our consolidated balance sheet. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized. To the extent we believe that realization is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance. When we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period, we record a corresponding tax expense in our consolidated statement of operations.\nWe record a valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize our deferred tax assets before they expire. We assess the need for an adjustment to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. The assessment is based on our estimates of future sources of taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we operate and the periods over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable. While we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance for the periods presented, we could in the future be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize. An increase in the valuation allowance could have an adverse impact on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which we record the change.\nWe recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. The first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. Significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. We evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. Our evaluations are based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues. Changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change, which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results. See Note 10 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information.\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 can be found under Item 7 of Part II in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on August 31, 2020, which is available free of charge on the SEC\u2019s website at www.sec.gov and on the Investor Relations section of our corporate website at investors.intuit.com.\nFinancial Overview\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Fiscal\n2021 Fiscal\n2020 Fiscal\n2019 2021-2020\n% Change 2020-2019\n% Change\nTotal net revenue $9,633 $7,679 $6,784 25 % 13 %\nOperating income 2,500 2,176 1,854 15 % 17 %\nNet income 2,062 1,826 1,557 13 % 17 %\nDiluted net income per share $7.56 $6.92 $5.89 9 % 17 %\nTotal net revenue increased $2.0 billion or 25% in fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020. The acquisition of Credit Karma contributed $865 million to total revenue in fiscal 2021. Our Small Business & Self-Employed segment revenue increased 16% primarily due to growth in our Online Ecosystem revenue. Our Consumer segment revenue increased 14% primarily due to a shift in mix to our higher priced offerings including TurboTax Live and growth in TurboTax federal units. See \u201cSegment Results\u201d later in this Item 7 for more information.\nOperating income increased $324 million or 15% in fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020. The increase was due to the higher revenue described above partially offset by an increase in expenses primarily for staffing, marketing, share-based compensation, and amortization of other acquired intangible assets. See \u201cOperating Expenses\u201d later in this Item 7 for more information.\nNet income increased $236 million or 13% in fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020 due to the increase in operating income described above, a $30 million gain from the sale of a note receivable that was previously written off, and a $17 million gain on other long-term investments. These increases were partially offset by a higher tax expense for the period. Diluted net income per share increased 9% to $7.56 for fiscal 2021 due to the increase in net income, which was partially offset by an increase in the weighted average shares outstanding due to the shares issued as part of the acquisition of Credit Karma in the second quarter of fiscal 2021.\nSegment Results\nThe information below is organized in accordance with our four reportable segments. All of our segments operate and sell to customers primarily in the United States. Total international net revenue was less than 5% of consolidated total net revenue for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nIn August 2020, we reorganized certain technology and customer success functions that support and benefit our overall platform. Additionally, certain legal, facility and employee service costs are now managed at the corporate level. As a result, these costs are no longer included in segment operating income and are now included in other corporate expenses. For the twelve months ended July 31, 2020 and 2019, we reclassified $180 million and $172 million from Small Business & Self-Employed, $121 million and $78 million from Consumer, and $13 million and $12 million from ProConnect to other corporate expenses. In August 2020, we also renamed our Strategic Partner segment as the ProConnect segment. This segment continues to serve professional accountants.\nIn December 2020 we acquired Credit Karma in a business combination and it operates as a separate reportable segment. We have included the results of operations of Credit Karma in our consolidated statements of operations from the date of acquisition. See Note 6 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information. Segment operating income for Credit Karma includes all direct expenses, which is different from our other reportable segments where we do not fully allocate corporate expenses.\nSegment operating income is segment net revenue less segment cost of revenue and operating expenses. For our Small Business & Self-Employed, Consumer, and ProConnect reportable segments, we include expenses such as corporate selling and marketing, product development, and general and administrative, which are not allocated to specific segments, in unallocated corporate items as part of other corporate expenses. For Credit Karma, segment expenses include all direct expenses related to selling and marketing, product development, and general and administrative. Unallocated corporate items for all segments include share-based compensation, amortization of acquired technology, amortization of other acquired intangible assets, and goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges. These unallocated costs for all segments totaled $2.9 billion in fiscal 2021, $2.3 billion in fiscal 2020, and $2.0 billion in fiscal 2019.

The increase was primarily due to growth in Online Ecosystem revenue. Fiscal 2021 and 2020 revenue includes $20 million and $30 million, respectively, of nonrecurring revenue related to the Payroll Protection Program, of which $12 million and $16 million, respectively, related to our Online Ecosystem and $8 million and $14 million, respectively, related to our Desktop Ecosystem.\nOnline Ecosystem\nOnline Ecosystem revenue increased $568 million or 26% in fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020. QuickBooks Online Accounting revenue increased 25% in fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020 primarily due to an increase in customers, a shift in mix to our higher priced offerings and higher effective prices. Online Services revenue increased 27% in fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020 primarily due to an increase in revenue from our payments and payroll offerings. Online payments revenue increased due to an increase in customers and an increase in charge volume per customer. Online payroll revenue increased due to an increase in customers and a shift in mix to our full service offering.\nDesktop Ecosystem\nDesktop Ecosystem revenue increased $70 million in fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020 primarily due to growth in our QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise subscription offering due to an increase in customers and higher revenue for our desktop payments offering due to higher charge volume. Also, during fiscal 2021 there was an increase in revenue from license updates as a result of price increases that occurred during fiscal 2020. These increases were partially offset by a decline in desktop unit revenue.\nSmall Business & Self-Employed segment operating income increased $499 million or 24% in fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020 primarily due to the increase in revenue described above, partially offset by higher expenses. We incurred higher expenses for marketing, outside services, and sales related expenses, which were partially offset by a decrease in depreciation.\nIn August 2020, we reorganized certain technology and customer success functions that support and benefit our overall platform. Additionally, certain legal, facility and employee service costs are now managed at the corporate level. As a result, these costs are no longer included in segment operating income and are now included in other corporate expenses. For the twelve months ended July 31, 2020 and 2019, we reclassified $180 million and $172 million from Small Business & Self-Employed to other corporate expenses.\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nConsumer\nConsumer segment product revenue is derived primarily from TurboTax desktop tax return preparation software and related form updates.\nConsumer segment service and other revenue is derived primarily from TurboTax Online and TurboTax Live offerings, electronic tax filing services and connected services, and also from our Mint offering.\n(Dollars in millions) Fiscal\n2021 Fiscal\n2020 Fiscal\n2019 2021-2020\n% Change 2020-2019\n% Change\nProduct revenue $ 201 $ 203 $ 201\nService and other revenue 3,362 2,933 2,574\nTotal segment revenue $ 3,563 $ 3,136 $ 2,775 14 % 13 %\n% of total revenue 37 % 41 % 41 %\nSegment operating income $ 2,237 $ 2,063 $ 1,820 8 % 13 %\n% of related revenue 63 % 66 % 66 %\nRevenue for our Consumer segment increased $427 million or 14% in fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020 primarily due to a shift in mix to our higher priced product offerings including TurboTax Live and a 6% growth in TurboTax federal units.\nConsumer segment operating income increased $174 million or 8% in fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020 due to the higher revenue described above, which was partially offset by higher expenses for staffing, marketing, and outside services.\nIn August 2020, we reorganized certain technology and customer success functions that support and benefit our overall platform.

As a result, these costs are no longer included in segment operating income and are now included in other corporate expenses.

We expense costs of product revenue as they are incurred for delivered software and we do not defer any of these costs when product revenue is deferred.\nCost of service and other revenue as a percentage of service and other revenue decreased slightly in fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020. The acquisition of Credit Karma contributed $209 million to cost of service and other revenue for fiscal 2021. The decrease in cost of service and other revenue as a percentage of service and other revenue is primarily due to the increase in revenue described above. Additionally, during fiscal 2021 we experienced an increase in customer success costs for TurboTax Live due to customer growth, partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense.\nOperating Expenses\n(Dollars in millions) Fiscal\n2021 % of\nTotal\nNet\nRevenue Fiscal\n2020 % of\nTotal\nNet\nRevenue Fiscal\n2019 % of\nTotal\nNet\nRevenue\nSelling and marketing $ 2,644 28 % $ 2,048 27 % $ 1,927 28 %\nResearch and development 1,678 17 % 1,392 18 % 1,233 18 %\nGeneral and administrative 982 10 % 679 9 % 597 9 %\nAmortization of other acquired intangible assets 146 2 % 6 - % 6 - %\nTotal operating expenses $ 5,450 57 % $ 4,125 54 % $ 3,763 55 %\nTotal operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenue increased in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020.

The total amounts recorded in operating expenses for each period are approximately equal to the total amounts recorded in interest and other income in those periods.\n(3) In fiscal 2021 we recorded a $30 million gain from the sale of a note receivable that was previously written off and gains on other long-term investments of $17 million.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rates for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 were approximately 19% and 17%, respectively. Excluding the tax benefits related to share-based compensation, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 was approximately 24%. This rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to state income taxes and non-deductible share-based compensation, which were partially offset by the benefit we received from the federal research and experimentation credit. Excluding the tax benefits related to share-based compensation, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 was approximately 21%. This rate did not differ significantly from the federal statutory rate of 21% as state income taxes and non-deductible share-based compensation were substantially offset by the benefit we received from the federal research and experimentation credit. See Note 10 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information about our effective tax rates.\nAt July 31, 2021, we had net deferred tax liabilities of $517 million which included a valuation allowance for state research and experimentation tax credit carryforwards, foreign loss carryforwards, foreign intangible deferred tax assets and state operating and capital loss carryforwards. See \u201cCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d earlier in this Item 7 and Note 10 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information.\nIn the current global tax policy environment, the U.S. and other domestic and foreign governments continue to consider, and in some cases enact, changes in corporate tax laws. As changes occur, we account for finalized legislation in the period of enactment.\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOverview\nAt July 31, 2021, our cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $3.9 billion, a decrease of $3.2 billion from July 31, 2020 due to the factors described in \u201cStatements of Cash Flows\u201d below. Our primary sources of liquidity have been cash from operations, which includes the collection of accounts receivable for products and services, the issuance of senior unsecured notes, and borrowings under our credit facilities. Our primary uses of cash have been for research and development programs, selling and marketing activities, repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, the payment of cash dividends, debt service costs and debt repayment, acquisitions of businesses, and capital projects. As discussed in \u201cExecutive Overview - Industry Trends and Seasonality\u201d earlier in this Item 7, our business is subject to significant seasonality. The balance of our cash, cash equivalents and investments generally fluctuates with that seasonal pattern. We believe the seasonality of our business is likely to continue in the future.\nThe following table summarizes selected measures of our liquidity and capital resources at the dates indicated:\n(Dollars in millions) July 31,\n2021 July 31,\n2020 $\nChange %\nChange\nCash, cash equivalents and investments $ 3,870 $ 7,050 $ (3,180) (45) %\nLong-term investments 43 19 24 126 %\nShort-term debt - 1,338 (1,338) (100) %\nLong-term debt 2,034 2,031 3 - %\nWorking capital 2,502 4,451 (1,949) (44) %\nRatio of current assets to current liabilities 1.9 : 1 2.3 : 1\nWe have historically generated significant cash from operations and we expect to continue to do so during fiscal 2022. Our cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaled $3.9 billion at July 31, 2021, none of those funds were restricted, and approximately 92% of those funds were located in the U.S.\nOn December 3, 2020 we acquired Credit Karma. The fair value of the purchase consideration totaled $7.2 billion and included $3.4 billion in cash, 10.6 million shares of Intuit common stock with a fair value of $3.8 billion and assumed equity awards for services rendered through the acquisition date of $47 million. See \"Business Combinations\" below for more information.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we borrowed the full $1 billion under our unsecured revolving credit facility which we repaid In August 2020. The unsecured revolving credit facility is available to us for general corporate purposes. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we also issued $2 billion in senior unsecured notes for general corporate purposes, which was used to fund a portion of the acquisition of Credit Karma. See \u201cCommitments for Senior Unsecured Notes\u201d later in this Item 7 for more information.\nBased on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, investments, and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements, contractual obligations, commitments, debt service requirements, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for at least the next 12 months. We believe that our financial resources will allow us to manage any impact of COVID-19 on our business operations for the foreseeable future, which could include potential reductions in revenue and delays in payments from customers and partners.\nWe expect to return excess cash generated by operations to our stockholders through payment of cash dividends, after taking into account our operating and strategic cash needs.\nOur secured revolving credit facility is available to fund a portion of our loans to qualified small businesses. At July 31, 2021, $48 million was outstanding under the secured revolving credit facility. See \u201cCredit Facilities\u201d later in this Item 7 for more information.\nWe evaluate, on an ongoing basis, the merits of acquiring technology or businesses, or establishing strategic relationships with and investing in other companies. Our strong liquidity profile enables us to quickly respond to these kinds of opportunities.\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nStatements of Cash Flows\nThe following table summarizes selected items from our consolidated statements of cash flows for fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020, and fiscal 2019.

We also received $2 billion from the issuance of senior unsecured notes, $1 billion from borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility, $44 million for net principal repayments of term loans, and $25 million from the net sales and maturities of investments. During the same period we used $561 million for the payment of cash dividends, $323 million for the repurchase of shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, $137 million for capital expenditures, $50 million for the repayment of debt, and $33 million from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans, net of payments for employee taxes withheld upon vesting of restricted stock units.\nStock Repurchase Programs and Dividends on Common Stock\nAs described in Note 11 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report, during fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 we continued to repurchase shares of our common stock under a series of repurchase programs that our Board of Directors has authorized. At July 31, 2021, we had authorization from our Board of Directors to expend up to an additional $1.3 billion for stock repurchases. On August 20, 2021 our Board approved a new stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to an additional $2 billion of our common stock. We currently expect to continue repurchasing our common stock on a quarterly basis; however, future stock repurchases under the current program are at the discretion of management, and authorization of future stock repurchase programs is subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.\nWe have continued to pay quarterly cash dividends on shares of our outstanding common stock. During fiscal 2021 we declared cash dividends that totaled $2.36 per share of outstanding common stock or approximately $651 million. In August 2021 our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.68 per share of outstanding common stock payable on October 18, 2021 to stockholders of records at the close of business on October 11, 2021. We currently expect to continue paying comparable cash dividends on a quarterly basis; however, future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record dates and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.\nBusiness Combinations\nOn December 3, 2020 we acquired Credit Karma for total consideration of $8.1 billion which included assumed equity awards and restricted shares subject to a revest provision.\nThe fair value of the purchase consideration totaled $7.2 billion and included $3.4 billion in cash, 10.6 million shares of Intuit common stock with a fair value of $3.8 billion and assumed equity awards for services rendered through the acquisition date of $47 million.\nWe also issued shares of common stock with a fair value of $275 million which are restricted due to a revest provision, and will be expensed over a service period of three years. The share-based compensation expense related to these restricted shares is non-deductible for income tax purposes. Additionally, we assumed equity awards for future services with a fair value of $663 million that are being charged to expense over the remaining service periods, which average approximately three years.\nThe fair value of the stock consideration is based on the December 2, 2020 closing price of Intuit common stock of $355.49.\nAs part of the merger agreement, following the close of the transaction, we issued approximately $300 million of restricted stock units to the employees of Credit Karma, which will be charged to expense over a service period of four years.\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nCredit Karma operates as a separate reportable segment. We have included the financial results of Credit Karma in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. See Note 6 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information.\nCommitments for Senior Unsecured Notes\nIn June 2020, we issued $2 billion of senior unsecured notes comprised of the following:\n\u2022$500 million of 0.650% notes due July 2023;\n\u2022$500 million of 0.950% notes due July 2025;\n\u2022$500 million of 1.350% notes due July 2027; and\n\u2022$500 million of 1.650% notes due July 2030 (together, the Notes).\nInterest is payable semiannually on January 15 and July 15 of each year. At July 31, 2021, our maximum commitment for interest payments under the Notes was $140 million through the maturity dates.\nThe Notes are senior unsecured obligations of Intuit and rank equally with all existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of Intuit and are redeemable by us at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. Upon the occurrence of change of control transactions that are accompanied by certain downgrades in the credit ratings of the Notes, we will be required to repurchase the Notes at a repurchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate outstanding principal plus any accrued and unpaid interest to but not including the date of repurchase. The indenture governing the Notes requires us to comply with certain covenants. For example, the Notes limit our ability to create certain liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions. As of July 31, 2021 we were compliant with all covenants governing the Notes. See Note 8 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information.\nCredit Facilities\nUnsecured Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan\nOn May 2, 2019 we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with certain institutional lenders for a credit facility with an aggregate principal amount of $1.4 billion, including a $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that matures on May 2, 2024 and a $400 million unsecured term loan that matured on February 1, 2021.\nUnder the amended and restated credit agreement we may, subject to certain customary conditions including lender approval, on one or more occasions increase commitments under the unsecured revolving credit facility in an amount not to exceed $250 million in the aggregate and may extend the maturity date up to two times. Advances under the unsecured revolving credit facility accrue interest at rates that are equal to, at our election, either Bank of America's alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0.0% to 0.1% or the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin that ranges from 0.69% to 1.1%. Actual margins under either election will be based on our senior debt credit ratings. In May 2020, we borrowed the full $1 billion under the unsecured revolving credit facility and during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 we repaid the outstanding balance. At July 31, 2021, no amounts were outstanding under the unsecured revolving credit facility. We currently believe that the credit facility will be available to us should we choose to borrow under it. We monitor counterparty risk associated with the institutional lenders that are providing the credit facility.\nOn February 1, 2021, we paid the $325 million remaining balance of the term loan upon maturity and at July 31, 2021, no amount was outstanding.The term loan accrued interest at rates that are equal to, at our election, either Bank of America's alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0.0% to 0.125% or LIBOR plus a margin that ranges from 0.625% to 1.125%. Under this agreement we may, subject to certain customary conditions including lender approval, on one or more occasions increase commitments under the term loan in an amount not to exceed $400 million in the aggregate. This option continues to be available to us through the maturity of the amended and restated credit agreement.\nThe amended and restated credit agreement includes customary affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants that require us to maintain a ratio of total gross debt to annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of not greater than 3.25 to 1.00 as of any date and a ratio of annual EBITDA to annual interest expense of not less than 3.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. As of July 31, 2021 we were compliant with all required covenants.\nSecured Revolving Credit Facility\nOn February 19, 2019 a subsidiary of Intuit entered into a $300 million secured revolving credit facility with a lender to fund a portion of our loans to qualified small businesses. The revolving credit facility is secured by cash and receivables of the subsidiary and is non-recourse to Intuit Inc. We have entered into several amendments to the secured revolving credit facility, most recently on July 16, 2021, primarily to extend the commitment term and maturity date. Under the amended agreement, $150 million of the facility is committed and $150 million is uncommitted. Advances accrue interest at LIBOR plus 1.5%. Unused portions of the committed credit facility accrue interest at a rate ranging from 0.25% to 0.75%, depending on the total unused committed balance. The commitment term is through July 17, 2023 and the final maturity date is January 17, 2024. The amended agreement allows for the transition of the benchmark interest rate used to calculate finance charges from\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nLIBOR to the Secured Overnight Finance Rate (SOFR) plus related benchmark adjustments that represent the prevailing market convention for dollar-denominated syndicated credit facilities. The agreement includes certain affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants that require the subsidiary to maintain specified financial ratios. As of July 31, 2021 we were compliant with all required covenants. At July 31, 2021, $48 million was outstanding under this facility and the weighted-average interest rate was 3.21%, which includes the interest on the unused committed portion. The outstanding balance is secured by cash and receivables of the subsidiary totaling $199 million.\nCash Held by Foreign Subsidiaries\nOur cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $3.9 billion at July 31, 2021. Approximately 8% of those funds were held by our foreign subsidiaries and subject to repatriation tax considerations. These foreign funds were located primarily in Canada, the United Kingdom, and India. As a result of the 2017 Tax Act we do not expect to pay incremental U.S. taxes on repatriation. We have recorded income tax expense for Canada and India withholding taxes on earnings that are not permanently reinvested. In the event that funds from foreign operations are repatriated to the United States, we would pay withholding taxes at that time.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nThe following table summarizes our known contractual obligations to make future payments at July 31, 2021:\nPayments Due by Period\nLess than 1-3 3-5 More than\n(In millions) 1 year years years 5 years Total\nAmounts due under executive deferred compensation plan $ 153 $ - $ - $ - $ 153\nSenior unsecured notes - 500 500 1,000 2,000\nSecured revolving credit facility - 48 - - 48\nInterest and fees due on debt 25 48 35 40 148\nOperating leases (1)\n76 159 107 139 481\nPurchase obligations (2)\n205 215 111 - 531\nTotal contractual obligations (3)\n$ 459 $ 970 $ 753 $ 1,179 $ 3,361\n(1)Includes operating leases for facilities and equipment.

(the Company) as of July 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2021, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at July 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated September 8, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nDetermination of Distinct Performance Obligations in Revenue Contracts\nDescription of the Matter As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company enters into contracts with customers that often include promises to transfer multiple products and services. The Company has generally concluded that software licenses and services are separate performance obligations and revenues from software licenses and services are recognized as those products and services are provided.\nGiven the nature of the Company\u2019s product and service offerings, there is complexity in determining whether software licenses and services are considered performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or together. Auditing the Company\u2019s determination of distinct performance obligations related to its various product and service offerings involved complex auditor judgment. In particular, significant judgment was required when assessing whether the promised products and services are separate performance obligations or inputs to a combined performance obligation due to the evaluation of the interdependency or interrelation of the promised products and services within each contract.\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nHow we Addressed the\nMatter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the Company\u2019s processes, as they relate to the determination of distinct performance obligations. We also obtained an understanding of the Company\u2019s product and service offerings and tested the application of the revenue recognition accounting model to determine distinct performance obligations.\nAmong other audit procedures, we evaluated whether the performance obligations identified by the Company were capable of being distinct and distinct in the context of the contract through review of contracts, discussions with management, observing product demonstrations and review of the Company\u2019s website and other marketing materials. More specifically, we evaluated the Company\u2019s determination of whether the contract was to deliver (1) multiple promised products or services that constitute separate performance obligations or (2) a single performance obligation that is comprised of the combined products or services. That is, considering the utility, integration, interrelation or interdependence of the products and services, we evaluated whether the multiple promised products and services that were delivered to the customer were outputs or inputs to a combined item.\nAccounting for Acquisition of Credit Karma\nDescription of the Matter As described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, during the year ended July 31, 2021, the Company completed its acquisition of Credit Karma for a total purchase price of $7.2 billion. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination.\nAuditing the Company's accounting for its acquisition of Credit Karma was complex due to the significant estimation uncertainty in determining the fair value of identified intangible assets, which primarily consisted of user relationships of $2,781 million, trade names/trademarks of $375 million, and purchased technology of $216 million. The significant estimation uncertainty was primarily due to the sensitivity of the respective fair values to underlying assumptions about the future performance of the acquired business. The significant assumptions used to estimate the fair values of the intangible assets included certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results including revenue growth rates and operating margins. Each of these assumptions was subjective and involved significant judgment as they are forward looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions.\nHow we Addressed the\nMatter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the Company\u2019s process for accounting for the acquisition. For example, we tested the controls over the recognition and determination of the fair values of the acquired intangible assets, including the development and review of the valuation models and underlying assumptions used to develop such estimates.\nTo test the estimated fair value of the user relationships, trade name/trademark and purchased technology intangible assets, we performed substantive audit procedures that included, among others, evaluating the Company\u2019s selection of valuation methodologies with the assistance of our valuation specialists, and evaluating the significant assumptions used by the Company to develop the forecasted results of Credit Karma including projected revenue growth rates and projected operating margins. For example, we compared the significant assumptions to current industry, market and economic trends, and to the historical results of the acquired business. We tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the valuation.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 1990.\nSan Jose, California\nSeptember 8, 2021\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Intuit Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Intuit Inc.\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Intuit Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2021, based on the COSO criteria.\nAs indicated in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management\u2019s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Credit Karma, which is included in the July 31, 2021 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted nine percent of both total and net assets, respectively, as of July 31, 2021 and nine percent of both revenues and net income, respectively, for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Credit Karma.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2021 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated September 8, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nSeptember 8, 2021\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nINTUIT INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\nTwelve Months Ended July 31,\n(In millions, except per share amounts) 2021 2020 2019\nNet revenue:\nProduct $ 1,698 $ 1,635 $ 1,623\nService and other 7,935 6,044 5,161\nTotal net revenue 9,633 7,679 6,784\nCosts and expenses:\nCost of revenue:\nCost of product revenue 69 72 77\nCost of service and other revenue 1,564 1,284 1,070\nAmortization of acquired technology 50 22 20\nSelling and marketing 2,644 2,048 1,927\nResearch and development 1,678 1,392 1,233\nGeneral and administrative 982 679 597\nAmortization of other acquired intangible assets 146 6 6\nTotal costs and expenses 7,133 5,503 4,930\nOperating income 2,500 2,176 1,854\nInterest expense (29) (14) (15)\nInterest and other income, net 85 36 42\nIncome before income taxes 2,556 2,198 1,881\nIncome tax provision 494 372 324\nNet income $ 2,062 $ 1,826 $ 1,557\nBasic net income per share $ 7.65 $ 6.99 $ 5.99\nShares used in basic per share calculations 270 261 260\nDiluted net income per share $ 7.56 $ 6.92 $ 5.89\nShares used in diluted per share calculations 273 264 264\nCash dividends declared per common share $ 2.36 $ 2.12 $ 1.88\nSee accompanying notes.\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nINTUIT INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nTwelve Months Ended July 31,\n(In millions) 2021 2020 2019\nNet income $ 2,062 $ 1,826 $ 1,557\nOther comprehensive income (loss), net of income taxes:\nUnrealized gain (loss) on available-for-sale debt securities (3) 5 3\nForeign currency translation gain (loss) 11 (1) (3)\nTotal other comprehensive income, net 8 4 -\nComprehensive income $ 2,070 $ 1,830 $ 1,557\nSee accompanying notes.\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nINTUIT INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nJuly 31,\n(Dollars in millions, except par value; shares in thousands) 2021 2020\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 2,562 $ 6,442\nInvestments 1,308 608\nAccounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $96 and $12\n391 149\nIncome taxes receivable 123 12\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 316 314\nCurrent assets before funds held for customers 4,700 7,525\nFunds held for customers 457 455\nTotal current assets 5,157 7,980\nLong-term investments 43 19\nProperty and equipment, net 780 734\nOperating lease right-of-use assets 380 226\nGoodwill 5,613 1,654\nAcquired intangible assets, net 3,252 28\nLong-term deferred income taxes 8 65\nOther assets 283 225\nTotal assets $ 15,516 $ 10,931\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities:\nShort-term debt $ -

As a result, these costs are no longer included in segment operating income and are now included in other corporate expenses. For the twelve months ended July 31, 2020 and 2019, we reclassified $180 million and $172 million from Small Business & Self-Employed, $121 million and $78 million from Consumer, and $13 million and $12 million from ProConnect to other corporate expenses. In August 2020, we also renamed our Strategic Partner segment as the ProConnect segment. This segment continues to serve professional accountants. See Note 14, \"Segment Information,\" for more information.\nOn December 3, 2020 we acquired Credit Karma, a consumer technology platform. We have included the results of operations for Credit Karma in our consolidated statements of operations from the date of acquisition. Credit Karma operates as a separate reportable segment. See Note 14, \"Segment Information,\" for more information.\nSeasonality\nOur Consumer and ProConnect offerings have a significant and distinct seasonal pattern as sales and revenue from our income tax preparation products and services are typically concentrated in the period from November through April. This seasonal pattern typically results in higher net revenues during our second and third quarters ending January 31 and April 30, respectively.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the timing of tax filing seasons for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 varied significantly. In fiscal 2019, the IRS began accepting returns on January 28, 2019 and the tax filing deadline was April 15, 2019. In fiscal 2020, the IRS began accepting returns on January 27, 2020 and the tax filing deadline was July 15, 2020. In fiscal 2021, the IRS began accepting returns on February 12, 2021 and the tax filing deadline was May 17, 2021. These changes to the tax filing seasons impacted our quarterly financial results during fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020.\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nUse of Estimates\nIn preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we make certain judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the disclosures made in the accompanying notes. For example, we use judgments and estimates in determining how revenue should be recognized. These judgments and estimates include identifying performance obligations, determining if the performance obligations are distinct, determining the standalone sales price (SSP) and timing of revenue recognition for each distinct performance obligation, and estimating variable consideration to be included in the transaction price. We use estimates in determining the collectibility of accounts receivable and notes receivable, the appropriate levels of various accruals including accruals for litigation contingencies, the discount rate used to calculate lease liabilities, the amount of our worldwide tax provision, the realizability of deferred tax assets, the credit losses of available-for-sale debt securities, and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for business combinations. We also use estimates in determining the remaining economic lives and fair values of acquired intangible assets, property and equipment, and other long-lived assets. In addition, we use assumptions to estimate the fair value of reporting units and share-based compensation. Despite our intention to establish accurate estimates and use reasonable assumptions, actual results may differ from our estimates. Additionally, in the context of the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic, while there has been no material impact on our estimates to date, in future periods, facts and circumstances could change and impact our estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive revenue from the sale of software subscriptions, hosted services, payroll services, merchant payment processing services, packaged software products, live expert advice, financing for small businesses, delivery of qualified links, financial supplies and hardware. We enter into contracts with customers that include promises to transfer various products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized when the promised goods or services are transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration allocated to the respective performance obligation.\nNature of Products and Services\nDesktop Offerings\nOur desktop offerings consist of our QuickBooks Desktop products, which include both packaged software products and software subscriptions, our consumer and professional tax desktop products, which include TurboTax, Lacerte and ProSeries, our desktop payroll products, and merchant payment processing services for small businesses who use our desktop offerings.\nOur QuickBooks Desktop packaged software products include a perpetual software license as well as enhancements and connected services. We recognize revenue for our QuickBooks Desktop packaged software products at the time the software license is delivered. We have determined that the enhancements and connected services included in our QuickBooks Desktop packaged software products are immaterial within the context of the contract.\nOur QuickBooks Desktop software subscriptions include a term software license, version protection, enhancements, support and various connected services. We recognize revenue for the software license and version protection at the time they are delivered and recognize revenue for support and connected services over the subscription term as the services are provided. We have determined that the enhancements included in our QuickBooks Desktop software subscriptions are immaterial within the context of the contract.\nOur consumer and professional tax packaged desktop software products include an on-premise tax software license, related tax form updates, electronic filing service and connected services. We recognize revenue for the software license and related tax form updates, as one performance obligation, over the period the forms and updates are delivered. We recognize revenue for our electronic filings service and connected services as those services are provided.\nWe also sell some of our QuickBooks Desktop packaged software products and consumer tax packaged desktop software products in non-consignment and consignment arrangements to certain retailers. For non-consignment retailers, we begin recognizing revenue when control has transferred to the retailer. For consignment retailers, we begin recognizing revenue when control has transferred to the customer, at the time the end-user sale has occurred.\nOur desktop payroll products are sold as software subscriptions and include a term software license with a stand-ready obligation to maintain compliance with current payroll tax laws, support and connected services. The term software license and stand-ready obligation to maintain compliance with current payroll tax laws is considered one performance obligation. Each of the performance obligations is considered distinct and control is transferred to the customer over the subscription term. As a result, revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription term as services are provided.\nWe offer merchant payment processing services as a separately paid connected service for our QuickBooks Desktop packaged software products and software subscriptions, and revenue is recognized as the services are provided to the customers.\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nOnline Offerings\nOur online offerings include TurboTax Online and TurboTax Live, ProConnect Tax Online, QuickBooks Online, online payroll, and merchant payment processing services for small businesses who use our online offerings.\nThese online offerings provide customers with the right to use the hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software and are billed on either a subscription or consumption basis. Revenue related to our online offerings that are billed on a subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to online offerings that are billed on a consumption basis, is recognized when the customer consumes the related service.\nOther Solutions\nRevenue from our Credit Karma segment is primarily comprised of revenue from the delivery of qualified links that result in completed actions, or cost-per-action transactions. Credit Karma also generates revenue from cost-per-click and cost-per-lead transactions. All revenue from our Credit Karma segment is included in service and other revenue on our consolidated statement of operations.\nCost-per-action revenue is earned based on a pre-determined fee for approved actions such as when credit cards are issued or when personal loans and other loans to businesses are funded and is recognized as the actions are completed.\nCost-per-click and cost-per-lead revenue is primarily related to mortgage and insurance businesses. Cost-per-click revenue is earned as users click on our customers' advertisements and is recognized based on the number of clicks recorded each month. Cost-per-lead revenue is earned via customer advertisements that allow the generation of leads from consumers interested in the advertised products and is recognized at the time a consumer request or lead is delivered to the customer.\nRevenue from the sale of our financial supplies, such as printed check stock and hardware, such as retail point-of-sale equipment and credit card readers for mobile phones, is recognized when control is transferred to the customer which is generally when the products are shipped.\nWe also have revenue-sharing and royalty arrangements with third-party partners and recognize this revenue as earned based upon reporting provided to us by our partners. In instances where we do not have reporting from our partners, we estimate revenue based on information available to us at the time.\nProduct Revenue and Service and Other Revenue\nProduct revenue includes revenue from: QuickBooks Desktop software licenses and version protection; consumer and professional tax desktop licenses and the related form updates; desktop payroll licenses and related updates; and financial supplies.\nService and other revenue includes revenue from: our online offerings discussed above; support, electronic filing services and connected services included with our desktop offerings; merchant payment processing services for our desktop offerings; and revenue-sharing and royalty arrangements.\nWe record revenue net of sales tax obligations. For payroll services, we generally require customers to remit payroll tax funds to us in advance of the payroll date via electronic funds transfer. We include in total net revenue the interest earned on these funds between the time that we collect them from customers and the time that we remit them to outside parties. Revenue for electronic payment processing services that we provide to merchants is recorded net of interchange fees charged by credit card associations.\nJudgments and Estimates\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. In determining how revenue should be recognized, a five-step process is used, which requires judgment and estimates. These judgments and estimates include identifying performance obligations in the contract, determining whether the performance obligations are distinct, determining the SSP for each distinct performance obligation, determining the timing of revenue recognition for distinct performance obligations and estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price.\nThe functionality of the software licenses included in our consumer and professional tax and payroll desktop offerings is dependent on the related enhancements and updates included in these offerings. Judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the related updates and recognized over time.\nOur contracts with customers include promises to transfer various products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct performance obligations. In many cases SSPs for distinct performance obligations are based on directly observable pricing. In instances where the SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs.\nOur consumer and professional tax desktop products include an on-premise tax software license and related tax form updates that are recognized as the forms and updates are delivered. We measure progress towards complete satisfaction of the software license and related tax form updates using an output method based on the timing of when the tax forms are delivered.\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nWe generally provide refunds to customers for product returns and subscription cancellations. We also provide promotional discounts and incentive rebates on retail and distribution sales. These refunds, discounts and incentive rebates are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. Refunds are estimated based on historical experience and current business and economic indicators and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional information becomes available to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of any incremental revenue will not occur. Discounts and incentive rebates are estimated based on distributors' and retailers' performance against the terms and conditions of the rebate programs.\nDeferred Revenue\nWe record deferred revenue when we have entered into a contract with a customer and cash payments are received or due prior to transfer of control or satisfaction of the related performance obligation. During the twelve months ended July 31, 2021, we recognized revenue of $652 million, that was included in deferred revenue at July 31, 2020. During the twelve months ended July 31, 2020, we recognized revenue of $619 million, that was included in deferred revenue at July 31, 2019.\nOur performance obligations are generally satisfied within 12 months of the initial contract date. As of July 31, 2021 and 2020, the deferred revenue balance related to performance obligations that will be satisfied after 12 months was $8 million and $13 million, respectively, and is included in other long-term obligations on our consolidated balance sheets.\nAssets Recognized from the Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer\nOur internal sales commissions are considered incremental costs of obtaining the contract with a customer. Internal sales commissions for subscription offerings where we expect the benefit of those costs to continue longer than one year are capitalized and amortized ratably over the period of benefit, which ranges from three to four years. Total capitalized costs to obtain a contract are not significant and are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe apply a practical expedient to expense costs incurred to obtain a contract with a customer when the period of benefit is less than one year. These costs primarily include internal and external sales commissions for our consumer and professional tax offerings.\nShipping and Handling\nWe record the amounts we charge our customers for the shipping and handling of our software products as product revenue and we record the related costs as cost of product revenue in our consolidated statements of operations.\nCustomer Service and Technical Support\nWe include the costs of customer service and technical support associated with our online or hosted offerings in cost of service and other revenue line in our consolidated statements of operations. We also include the costs of providing technical support for our desktop offerings in cost of service and other revenue. We include the costs of customer service related to desktop offerings in selling and marketing expense in our consolidated statements of operations. Customer service and technical support costs include costs associated with performing order processing, answering customer inquiries by telephone and through websites, e-mail and other electronic means, and providing technical support assistance to customers. We expense the cost of providing this support as incurred.\nSoftware Development Costs\nWe expense software development costs as we incur them until technological feasibility has been established, at which time those costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. To date, our software has been available for general release concurrent with the establishment of technological feasibility and, accordingly, we have not capitalized any development costs. Costs we incur to enhance our existing products or after the general release of the service using the product are expensed in the period they are incurred and included in research and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations.\nInternal Use Software\nWe capitalize costs related to development of hosted services that we provide to our customers and internal use of enterprise-level business and finance software in support of our operational needs. Costs incurred in the application development phase are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, which are generally three to six years. Costs related to planning and other preliminary project activities and to post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred. We test these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact their recoverability.\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nAdvertising\nWe expense all advertising costs as we incur them to selling and marketing expense in our consolidated statements of operations. We recorded advertising expense of approximately $1.1 billion for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021, $778 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2020, and $800 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2019.\nLeases\nOur leases are primarily operating leases for office facilities. We do not have significant finance leases. We determine if an arrangement is a lease and classify it as either a finance or operating lease at lease inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets, other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.\nOperating lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. Our leases generally do not have a readily determinable implicit rate, therefore we use our incremental borrowing rate at the commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. Our incremental borrowing rate is determined based on a yield curve derived from publicly traded bond offerings for companies with similar credit ratings to us. Our lease terms may include options to purchase, extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.\nWe measure ROU assets based on the corresponding lease liabilities adjusted for any initial direct costs and prepaid lease payments made to the lessor before or at the commencement date, net of lease incentives. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Variable lease payments are not included in the calculation of the ROU asset and lease liability and are recognized as lease expense is incurred. Our variable lease payments generally relate to amounts paid to lessors for common area maintenance under our real estate leases.\nOur subleases generally do not relieve us of our primary obligations under the corresponding head lease. As a result, we account for the head lease based on the original assessment at inception. We determine if the sublease arrangement is either a sales-type, direct financing, or operating lease at inception. If the total remaining lease cost on the head lease for the term of the sublease is greater than the anticipated sublease income, the ROU asset is assessed for impairment. Our subleases are generally operating leases and we recognize sublease income on a straight-line basis over the sublease term.\nCapitalization of Interest Expense\nWe capitalize interest on capital projects, including facilities build-out projects and internal use computer software projects. Capitalization commences with the first expenditure for the project and continues until the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. We amortize capitalized interest to depreciation expense using the straight-line method over the same lives as the related assets. Capitalized interest was not significant for any period presented.\nForeign Currency\nThe functional currencies of our international operating subsidiaries are generally the local currencies. We translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date. We translate their revenue, costs and expenses at the average rates of exchange in effect during the period. We include translation gains and losses in the stockholders\u2019 equity section of our consolidated balance sheets. We include net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions in interest and other income in our consolidated statements of operations. Translation gains and losses and transaction gains and losses were not significant for any period presented.\nIncome Taxes\nWe estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. We estimate our current tax liability and assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which we show on our consolidated balance sheet. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized. To the extent we believe that realization is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance. When we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period, we record a corresponding income tax expense in our consolidated statement of operations.\nWe review the need for a valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets before they expire. The valuation allowance analysis is based on our estimates of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the periods over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable. While we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance for the periods presented, we could be required to record a valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize. An increase in the valuation allowance would have an adverse impact, which could be material, on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which we record the increase.\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nWe recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. The first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. Significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. We evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. Our evaluations are based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues. Changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change, which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results.\nA description of our accounting policies associated with tax-related contingencies and valuation allowances assumed as part of a business combination is provided under \u201cBusiness Combinations\u201d below.\nComputation of Net Income (Loss) Per Share\nWe compute basic net income or loss per share using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. We compute diluted net income per share using the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive potential common shares consist of the shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options and upon the vesting of restricted stock units (RSUs) under the treasury stock method.\nWe include stock options with combined exercise prices and unrecognized compensation expense that are less than the average market price for our common stock, and RSUs with unrecognized compensation expense that is less than the average market price for our common stock, in the calculation of diluted net income per share. We exclude stock options with combined exercise prices and unrecognized compensation expense that are greater than the average market price for our common stock, and RSUs with unrecognized compensation expense that is greater than the average market price for our common stock, from the calculation of diluted net income per share because their effect is anti-dilutive. Under the treasury stock method, the amount that must be paid to exercise stock options and the amount of compensation expense for future service that we have not yet recognized for stock options and RSUs are assumed to be used to repurchase shares.\nAll of the RSUs we grant have dividend rights. Dividend rights are accumulated and paid when the underlying RSUs vest. Since the dividend rights are subject to the same vesting requirements as the underlying equity awards they are considered a contingent transfer of value. Consequently, the RSUs are not considered participating securities and we do not present them separately in earnings per share.\nThe following table presents the composition of shares used in the computation of basic and diluted net income per share for the periods indicated.\nTwelve Months Ended July 31,\n(In millions, except per share amounts) 2021 2020 2019\nNumerator:\nNet income $ 2,062 $ 1,826 $ 1,557\nDenominator:\nShares used in basic per share amounts:\nWeighted average common shares outstanding 270 261 260\nShares used in diluted per share amounts:\nWeighted average common shares outstanding 270 261 260\nDilutive common equivalent shares from stock options and restricted stock awards 3 3 4\nDilutive weighted average common shares outstanding 273 264 264\nBasic and diluted net income per share:\nBasic net income per share $ 7.65 $ 6.99 $ 5.99\nDiluted net income per share $ 7.56 $ 6.92 $ 5.89\nShares excluded from diluted net income per share:\nWeighted average stock options and restricted stock units that have been excluded from dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding due to their anti-dilutive effect - - 1\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nCash Equivalents and Investments\nWe consider highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. In all periods presented, cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds and time deposits. Investments consist primarily of investment-grade available-for-sale debt securities. Except for direct obligations of the United States government, securities issued by agencies of the United States government, and money market funds, we diversify our investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer.\nWe use the specific identification method to compute gains and losses on investments. We record unrealized gains and losses on investments, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income in the stockholders\u2019 equity section of our consolidated balance sheets and reflect unrealized gain and loss activity in other comprehensive income on our consolidated statement of comprehensive income. We generally classify available-for-sale debt securities as current assets based upon our ability and intent to use any and all of these securities as necessary to satisfy the significant short-term liquidity requirements that may arise from the highly seasonal nature of our businesses. Because of our significant business seasonality, stock repurchase programs, and acquisition opportunities, cash flow requirements may fluctuate dramatically from quarter to quarter and require us to use a significant amount of the investments we hold as available-for-sale.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowances for Doubtful Accounts\nAccounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and are not interest bearing. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for credit losses. In determining the amount of the allowance, we consider our historical level of credit losses, current economic trends that might impact the level of future credit losses, customer-specific information, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions to inform adjustments to historical loss data. We make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. When we determine that amounts are uncollectible we write them off against the allowance.\nNotes Receivable and Allowances for Loan Losses\nNotes receivable consist of term loans to small businesses and are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. As of July 31, 2021 and July 31, 2020, the notes receivable balance was $139 million and $40 million, respectively, and the allowances for loan losses were not material. The term loans are not secured and are recorded at amortized cost, net of allowances for loan losses. We maintain an allowance for loan losses to reserve for potentially uncollectible notes receivable. We evaluate the creditworthiness of our loan portfolio on a pooled basis due to its composition of small, homogeneous loans with similar general credit risk and characteristics and apply a loss rate at the time of loan origination. The loss rate and underlying model are updated periodically to reflect actual loan performance and changes in assumptions. We make judgments about the known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect borrowers\u2019 ability to repay and current economic conditions. When we determine that amounts are uncollectible, we write them off against the allowance.\nPaycheck Protection Program - In April 2020, Intuit was approved as a non-bank Small Business Administration (SBA) lender for the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). The PPP was authorized under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) to provide small businesses loans to pay payroll and group health costs, salaries and commissions, mortgage and rent payments, utilities, and interest on other debt which is designed to provide assistance to small businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lending under the program expired on August 8, 2020. As of July 31, 2021, all of the loans held for sale under this program have been sold. When loans under this program do not qualify to be sold, they are held for investment. As of July 31, 2021 and July 31, 2020, PPP loans held for investment were not material and are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. The SBA re-opened the PPP in January 2021 under the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2021. We marketed and referred small businesses to another lender under the re-opened program, but did not originate or service loans in this round of the program, which ended in May 2021.\nFunds Held for Customers and Customer Fund Deposits\nFunds held for customers represent cash held on behalf of our customers that is invested in cash and cash equivalents and investment-grade available-for-sale debt securities, restricted for use solely for the purpose of satisfying amounts we owe on behalf of our customers. Customer fund deposits consist of amounts we owe on behalf of our customers, such as direct deposit payroll funds and payroll taxes.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is stated at the lower of cost or realizable value, net of accumulated depreciation. We calculate depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from two to 30 years. We amortize leasehold improvements using the straight-line method over the lesser of their estimated useful lives or remaining lease terms. We include the amortization of assets that are recorded under finance leases in depreciation expense. We review property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nasset may not be recoverable. We did not record any significant property impairment charges during the twelve months ended July 31, 2021, 2020, or 2019.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to use significant estimates and assumptions, including fair value estimates, as of the business combination date and to refine those estimates as necessary during the measurement period (defined as the period, not to exceed one year, in which we may adjust the provisional amounts recognized for a business combination).\nUnder the acquisition method of accounting we recognize separately from goodwill the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interests in an acquiree, generally at the acquisition date fair value. We measure goodwill as of the acquisition date as the excess of consideration transferred, which we also measure at fair value, over the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Costs that we incur to complete the business combination such as investment banking, legal and other professional fees are not considered part of consideration and we charge them to general and administrative expense as they are incurred. Under the acquisition method we also account for acquired company restructuring activities that we initiate separately from the business combination.\nShould the initial accounting for a business combination be incomplete by the end of a reporting period that falls within the measurement period, we report provisional amounts in our financial statements. During the measurement period, we adjust the provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date and we record those adjustments to our financial statements. We apply those measurement period adjustments that we determine to be significant retrospectively to comparative information in our financial statements, including adjustments to depreciation and amortization expense.\nUnder the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, if we identify changes to acquired deferred tax asset valuation allowances or liabilities related to uncertain tax positions during the measurement period and they relate to new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, those changes are considered a measurement period adjustment and we record the offset to goodwill. We record all other changes to deferred tax asset valuation allowances and liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in current period income tax expense. This accounting applies to all of our acquisitions regardless of acquisition date.\nGoodwill, Acquired Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\nGoodwill\nWe record goodwill when the fair value of consideration transferred in a business combination exceeds the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but we test them for impairment annually during our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable.\nIn accordance with authoritative guidance, we define fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. We consider and use all valuation methods that are appropriate in estimating the fair value of our reporting units and generally use a weighted combination of income and market approaches. Under the income approach, we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit based on the present value of future cash flows. We use a number of assumptions in our discounted cash flow model, including market factors specific to the business, the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the business over an extended period of time, long-term growth rates for the business, and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money. Under the market approach, we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit based on market multiples of revenue, operating income, and earnings for comparable publicly traded companies engaged in similar businesses. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not impaired.\nIf the carrying value of the net assets assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value of the unit, we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. We recorded no goodwill impairment charges for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021, 2020 or 2019.\nAcquired Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\nWe generally record acquired intangible assets that have finite useful lives, such as purchased technology, in connection with business combinations. We amortize the cost of acquired intangible assets on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from two to fifteen years. We review intangible assets that have finite useful lives and other long-lived assets whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. We estimate the recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that we expect the asset to generate. We estimate the fair value of assets that have finite useful lives based on the present value of future cash flows for those assets. If the carrying value of an asset with a finite life exceeds its estimated fair\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nvalue, we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. Impairment charges for acquired intangible assets were not significant for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021, 2020 or 2019.\nShare-Based Compensation Plans\nWe estimate the fair value of stock options granted using a lattice binomial model and a multiple option award approach. We amortize the fair value of stock options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods.\nRestricted stock units (RSUs) granted typically vest based on continued service. We value these time-based RSUs at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method. We amortize the fair value of time-based RSUs on a straight-line basis over the service period. Certain RSUs granted to senior management vest based on the achievement of pre-established performance or market goals. We estimate the fair value of performance-based RSUs at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method and the probability that the specified performance criteria would be met. Each quarter we update our assessment of the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved and adjust our estimate of the fair value of the performance-based RSUs if necessary. We amortize the fair values of performance-based RSUs over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award. We estimate the fair value of market-based RSUs at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation methodology and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award. The Monte Carlo methodology that we use to estimate the fair value of market-based RSUs at the date of grant incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied. Provided that the requisite service is rendered, the total fair value of the market-based RSUs at the date of grant must be recognized as compensation expense even if the market condition is not achieved. However, the number of shares that ultimately vest can vary significantly with the performance of the specified market criteria. All of the RSUs we grant have dividend rights that are subject to the same vesting requirements as the underlying equity awards, so we do not adjust the intrinsic (market) value of our RSUs for dividends.\nSee Note 11, \u201cStockholders\u2019 Equity,\u201d for a description of our share-based compensation plans and more information on the assumptions we use to calculate the fair value of share-based compensation.\nConcentration of Credit Risk and Significant Customers and Suppliers\nWe operate in markets that are highly competitive and rapidly changing. Significant technological changes, shifting customer needs, the emergence of competitive products or services with new capabilities and other factors could negatively impact our operating results.\nWe are also subject to risks related to changes in the value of our significant balance of investments. Our portfolio of investments consists of investment-grade securities. Except for direct obligations of the United States government, securities issued by agencies of the United States government and money market funds, we diversify our investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer.\nWe sell a portion of our products through third-party retailers and distributors. As a result, we face risks related to the collectibility of our accounts receivable. To appropriately manage this risk, we perform ongoing evaluations of customer credit and limit the amount of credit extended as we deem appropriate, but generally do not require collateral. We maintain reserves for estimated credit losses and these losses have historically been within our expectations. However, since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, we cannot guarantee that our reserves will continue to be adequate. No customer accounted for 10% or more of total net revenue for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021, 2020 or 2019, nor did any customer account for 10% or more of total accounts receivable at July 31, 2021 or July 31, 2020.\nWe rely primarily on one third-party vendor to perform the manufacturing and distribution functions for our retail desktop software products. We also have a key single-source vendor that prints and fulfills orders for most of our financial supplies business. While we believe that relying on key vendors improves the efficiency and reliability of our business operations, relying on any one vendor for a significant aspect of our business can have a significant negative impact on our revenue and profitability if that vendor fails to perform at acceptable service levels for any reason, including financial difficulties of the vendor.\nAccounting Standards Recently Adopted\nInternal-Use Software - In August 2018 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2018-15, \u201cIntangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Internal-Use Software.\u201d This standard aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. We adopted this standard in the first quarter of our fiscal year beginning August 1, 2020 on a prospective basis. The adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nGoodwill Impairment - In January 2017 the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, \u201cIntangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.\u201d This standard eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Instead, an entity should compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nallocated to the reporting unit. We adopted this standard in the first quarter of our fiscal year beginning August 1, 2020 on a prospective basis. The adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nFinancial Instruments - In June 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, \u201cFinancial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326).\u201d This standard requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. We adopted this standard in the first quarter of our fiscal year beginning August 1, 2020. The adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nAccounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\nWe do not expect that any other recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a significant effect on our financial statements.\n2. Fair Value Measurements\nFair Value Hierarchy\nThe authoritative guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. When determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market for an asset or liability and assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. In addition, we consider and use all valuation methods that are appropriate in estimating the fair value of an asset or liability.\nThe authoritative guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that is based on the extent and level of judgment used to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities. In general, the authoritative guidance requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. An asset or liability\u2019s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement of its fair value. The three levels of input defined by the authoritative guidance are as follows:\n\u2022Level 1 uses unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\u2022Level 2 uses inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable through correlation with market data. These include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities: quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and inputs to valuation models or other pricing methodologies that do not require significant judgment because the inputs used in the model, such as interest rates and volatility, can be corroborated by readily observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\n\u2022Level 3 uses one or more unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the determination of fair value. Level 3 assets and liabilities include those whose fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar valuation techniques and significant management judgment or estimation.\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe following table summarizes financial assets and financial liabilities that we measured at fair value on a recurring basis at the dates indicated, classified in accordance with the fair value hierarchy described above.\nAt July 31, 2021 At July 31, 2020\n(In millions) Level 1 Level 2 Total\nFair Value Level 1 Level 2 Total\nFair Value\nAssets:\nCash equivalents, primarily money market funds and time deposits $ 1,660 $ - $ 1,660 $ 5,765 $ - $ 5,765\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities:\nMunicipal bonds - 38 38 - 9 9\nCorporate notes - 1,400 1,400 - 752 752\nU.S. agency securities - 70 70 - 47 47\nTotal available-for-sale securities - 1,508 1,508 - 808 808\nTotal assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis $ 1,660 $ 1,508 $ 3,168 $ 5,765 $ 808 $ 6,573\nLiabilities:\nSenior unsecured notes(1)\n$ - $ 1,986 $ 1,986 $ - $ 2,042 $ 2,042\n(1) Carrying value on our balance sheet at July 31, 2021 and July 31, 2020 was $1.99 billion and $1.98 billion, respectively. See Note 8, \u201cLong-Term Obligations and Commitments\u201d for more information.\nThe following table summarizes our cash equivalents and available-for-sale debt securities by balance sheet classification and level in the fair value hierarchy at the dates shown:\nAt July 31, 2021 At July 31, 2020\n(In millions) Level 1 Level 2 Total\nFair Value Level 1 Level 2 Total\nFair Value\nCash equivalents:\nIn cash and cash equivalents $ 1,660 $ - $ 1,660 $ 5,765 $ - $ 5,765\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities:\nIn investments $ - $ 1,308 $ 1,308 $ - $ 608 $ 608\nIn funds held for customers - 200 200 - 200 200\nTotal available-for-sale debt securities $ - $ 1,508 $ 1,508 $ - $ 808 $ 808\nWe value our Level 1 assets, consisting primarily of money market funds and time deposits, using quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments.\nFinancial assets whose fair values we measure on a recurring basis using Level 2 inputs consist of municipal bonds, corporate notes and U.S. agency securities. We measure the fair values of these assets with the help of a pricing service that either provides quoted market prices in active markets for identical or similar securities or uses observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Our fair value processes include controls designed to ensure that we record appropriate fair values for our Level 2 investments. These controls include comparison to pricing provided by a secondary pricing service or investment manager, validation of pricing sources and models, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period price fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.\nFinancial assets whose fair values we measure using Level 3 inputs consist of loans held for sale. These loans are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value. We had no loans held for sale at July 31, 2021 and $98 million at July 31, 2020. The difference between cost and fair value was not material.\nFinancial liabilities whose fair values we measure using Level 2 inputs consist of senior unsecured notes. See Note 8, \u201cLong-Term Obligations and Commitments\u201d for more information. We measure the fair value of our senior unsecured notes based on their trading prices and the interest rates we could obtain for other borrowings with similar terms.\nThere were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy during the twelve months ended July 31, 2021, 2020 or 2019.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis\nAssets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis include reporting units measured at fair value in a goodwill impairment test and our long-term investments.\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nEstimates of fair value for reporting units fall under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. During the fourth quarters of fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020, and fiscal 2019 we performed our annual goodwill impairment tests. Using the methodology described in Note 1, we determined that the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values and that they were not impaired.\nLong-term investments represent non-marketable equity securities in privately held companies that do not have a readily determinable fair value. They are accounted for at cost and adjusted based on observable price changes from orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. These investments are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the value based on valuation methods which may include a combination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, rights, and obligations of the investments we hold. As of July 31, 2021 and July 31, 2020, the carrying value of long-term investments was $43 million and $19 million, respectively, and adjustments to the carrying value of these investments for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021 were not significant.\n3.

Gross realized gains and losses on our available-for-sale debt securities for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were not significant.\nWe accumulate unrealized gains and losses on our available-for-sale debt securities, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in the stockholders\u2019 equity section of our consolidated balance sheets, except for certain unrealized losses described below. Gross unrealized gains and losses on our available-for-sale debt securities at July 31, 2021 and July 31, 2020 were not significant.\nFor available-for sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we determine whether a credit loss exists. The estimate of the credit loss is determined by considering available information relevant to the collectibility of the security and information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The allowance for credit loss is recorded to interest and other income on our consolidated statement of operations, not to exceed the amount of the unrealized loss. Any excess unrealized loss greater than the credit loss at a security level is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in the stockholders' equity section of our consolidated balance sheets. We determined there were no credit losses related to available-for-sale securities as of July 31, 2021. Unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities at July 31,\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\n2021 were not significant. We do not intend to sell these investments.

Business Combinations\nCredit Karma\nOn December 3, 2020 we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Credit Karma, a consumer technology platform. We acquired Credit Karma to help consumers unlock smart money decisions and accelerate our mission of powering prosperity around the world, by creating a personal financial assistant that helps consumers find the right financial products, put more money in their pockets and access financial expertise and advice. Credit Karma is a separate reportable segment. See Note 14, \"Segment Information,\" for more information. We have included the financial results of Credit Karma in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. For the twelve months ended July 31, 2021 and July 31, 2020, the transaction costs associated with the acquisition were approximately $31 million and $28 million, respectively, and were recorded in general and administrative expenses.\nWe acquired Credit Karma for total consideration of $8.1 billion which included assumed equity awards and restricted shares subject to a revest provision.\nThe fair value of the purchase consideration totaled $7.2 billion and included $3.4 billion in cash, 10.6 million shares of Intuit common stock with a fair value of $3.8 billion and assumed equity awards for services rendered through the acquisition date of $47 million.\nWe also issued shares of common stock with a fair value of $275 million which are restricted due to a revest provision, and are being be expensed over a service period of three years. The share-based compensation expense related to these restricted shares is non-deductible for income tax purposes. Additionally, we assumed equity awards for future services with a fair value of $663 million that are being charged to expense over the remaining service periods, which average approximately three years.\nThe fair value of the stock consideration is based on the December 2, 2020 closing price of Intuit common stock of $355.49.\nAs part of the merger agreement, following the close of the transaction, we issued approximately $300 million of restricted stock units to the employees of Credit Karma, which is being charged to expense over a service period of four years.\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nThe preliminary allocation of the Credit Karma purchase price is as follows:\n(In millions) Amount\nCash and cash equivalents $ 436\nAccounts receivable, net 141\nIncome taxes receivable 59\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 7\nLong-term investments 3\nProperty and equipment, net 63\nOperating lease right-of-use assets 167\nGoodwill 3,898\nIntangible assets 3,372\nOther assets 81\nAccounts payable (86)\nAccrued compensation and related liabilities (113)\nOther current liabilities (24)\nOperating lease liabilities (172)\nLong-term deferred income tax liabilities (627)\nOther long-term obligations (10)\nTotal preliminary purchase price allocation $ 7,195\nThe excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill, which is primarily attributed to the assembled workforce of Credit Karma and the synergies expected to be achieved. This goodwill is assigned to the new Credit Karma segment and is non-deductible for income tax purposes. The fair values assigned to tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are preliminary based on management's estimates and assumptions and may be subject to change as additional information is received and certain tax returns are finalized. We expect to finalize the valuation as soon as practicable, but not later than one year from the acquisition date.\nIntangible assets consist of user relationships, trade names/trademarks, purchased technology, and partner relationships. We amortize purchased intangible assets on a straight-line basis over their respective useful lives. The weighted average life of the total acquired identifiable intangible assets is 14.4 years.

The pro forma financial information for the twelve months ended July 31, 2020 combines our results for the twelve months ended July 31, 2020 and the historical results for Credit Karma for the twelve months ended June 30, 2020.\nThe following table summarizes the pro forma financial information:\nTwelve Months Ended July 31,\n(In millions) 2021 2020\nTotal revenue $ 9,876 $ 8,549\nNet income $ 1,977 $ 1,319\nBasic net income per share $ 7.21 $ 4.85\nDiluted net income per share $ 7.11 $ 4.80\n7. Current Liabilities\nShort-Term Debt\nOn May 2, 2019 we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with certain institutional lenders with an aggregate principal amount of $1.4 billion, including a $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that matures on May 2, 2024 and a $400 million unsecured term loan that was due on February 1, 2021.\nUnsecured Revolving Credit Facility\nThe amended and restated credit agreement we entered into on May 2, 2019 includes a $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire on May 2, 2024. Under this agreement we may, subject to certain customary conditions including lender approval, on one or more occasions increase commitments under the unsecured revolving credit facility in an amount not to exceed $250 million in the aggregate and may extend the maturity date up to two times. Advances under the unsecured revolving credit facility accrue interest at rates that are equal to, at our election, either Bank of America's alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0.0% to 0.1% or the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin that ranges from 0.69% to 1.1%. Actual margins under either election will be based on our senior debt credit ratings. The amended and restated credit agreement includes customary affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants that require us to maintain a ratio of total gross debt to annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of not greater than 3.25 to 1.00 as of any date and a ratio of annual EBITDA to annual interest expense of not less than 3.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. As of July 31, 2021 we were compliant with all required covenants. We repaid the $1 billion that was outstanding as of July 31, 2020 under this unsecured revolving credit facility during the first quarter of fiscal 2021, and at July 31, 2021 no amounts were outstanding. We paid $1 million for interest on the unsecured revolving credit facility during the twelve months ended July 31, 2021 and $2 million during the twelve months ended July 31, 2020. We paid no interest on the unsecured revolving credit facility during the twelve months ended July 31, 2019.\nTerm Loan\nOn February 1, 2021, we paid the $325 million remaining balance of the term loan upon maturity and at July 31, 2021, no amount was outstanding. The term loan accrued interest at rates that were equal to, at our election, either Bank of America's alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0.0% to 0.125% or LIBOR plus a margin that ranges from 0.625% to 1.125%. Interest on the term loan was payable monthly. We paid $2 million for interest on the term loan during the twelve months ended July 31, 2021, $9 million during the twelve months ended July 31, 2020, and $15 million during the twelve months ended July 31, 2019. Under the amended and restated agreement we may, subject to certain customary conditions including lender approval, on one or more occasions increase commitments under the term loan in an amount not to exceed $400 million in the aggregate. This option continues to be available to us through the expiration of the amended and restated credit agreement on May 2, 2024.\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nOther Current Liabilities\nOther current liabilities were as follows at the dates indicated:\nJuly 31,\n(In millions) 2021 2020\nExecutive deferred compensation plan liabilities $ 153 $ 123\nCurrent portion of operating lease liabilities 66 46\nReserve for returns and credits 21 24\nAmounts due for share repurchases 17 -\nReserve for promotional discounts and rebates 10 11\nCurrent portion of dividend payable 9 6\nInterest payable 1 3\nOther 84 84\nTotal other current liabilities $ 361 $ 297\n8. Long-Term Obligations and Commitments\nSenior Unsecured Notes\nIn June 2020 we issued four series of senior unsecured notes (together, the Notes) pursuant to a public debt offering. The proceeds from the issuance were $1.98 billion, net of debt discount of $2 million and debt issuance costs of $15 million.\nThe carrying value of the Notes was as follows at the date indicated:\nJuly 31, July 31, Effective\n(In millions) 2021 2020 Interest Rate\nSenior unsecured notes issued June 2020:\n0.650% notes due July 2023\n$ 500 $ 500 0.837%\n0.950% notes due July 2025\n500 500 1.127%\n1.350% notes due July 2027\n500 500 1.486%\n1.650% notes due July 2030\n500 500 1.767%\nTotal senior unsecured notes 2,000 2,000\nUnamortized discount and debt issuance costs (14) (17)\nNet carrying value senior unsecured notes $ 1,986 $ 1,983\nInterest is payable semiannually on January 15 and July 15 of each year. The discount and debt issuance costs are amortized to interest expense over the term of the Notes under the effective interest method. We paid $24 million for interest on the Notes during the twelve months ended July 31, 2021 and no interest during the twelve months ended July 31, 2020.\nThe Notes are senior unsecured obligations of Intuit and rank equally with all existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of Intuit and are redeemable by us at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. Upon the occurrence of change of control transactions that are accompanied by certain downgrades in the credit ratings of the Notes, we will be required to repurchase the Notes at a repurchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate outstanding principal plus any accrued and unpaid interest to but not including the date of repurchase. The indenture governing the Notes requires us to comply with certain covenants. For example, the Notes limit our ability to create certain liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions. As of July 31, 2021 we were compliant with all covenants governing the Notes.\nSecured Revolving Credit Facility\nOn February 19, 2019 a subsidiary of Intuit entered into a $300 million secured revolving credit facility with a lender to fund a portion of our loans to qualified small businesses. The revolving credit facility is secured by cash and receivables of the subsidiary and is non-recourse to Intuit Inc. We have entered into several amendments to the secured revolving credit facility, most recently on July 16, 2021, primarily to extend the commitment term and maturity date. Under the amended agreement, $150 million of the facility is committed and $150 million is uncommitted. Advances accrue interest at LIBOR plus 1.5%. Unused portions of the committed credit facility accrue interest at a rate ranging from 0.25% to 0.75%, depending on the total unused committed balance. The commitment term is through July 17, 2023 and the final maturity date is January 17, 2024. The amended agreement allows for the transition of the benchmark interest rate used to calculate finance charges from LIBOR to the Secured Overnight Finance Rate (SOFR) plus related benchmark adjustments that represent the prevailing\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nmarket convention for dollar-denominated syndicated credit facilities. The agreement includes certain affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants that require the subsidiary to maintain specified financial ratios. As of July 31, 2021 we were compliant with all required covenants. At July 31, 2021, $48 million was outstanding under this facility and the weighted-average interest rate was 3.21%, which includes the interest on the unused committed portion. The outstanding balance is secured by cash and receivables of the subsidiary totaling $199 million. Interest on the facility is payable monthly. We paid $3 million for interest on the secured revolving credit facility during each of the twelve months ended July 31, 2021 and 2020.\nFuture principal payments for long-term debt at July 31, 2021 were as shown in the table below.\n(In millions)\nFiscal year ending July 31,\n2022 $ -\n2023 500\n2024 48\n2025 500\n2026 -\nThereafter 1,000\nTotal commitments $ 2,048\nOther Long-Term Obligations\nOther long-term obligations were as follows at the dates indicated:\nJuly 31,\n(In millions) 2021 2020\nLong-term income tax liabilities $ 24 $ 10\nTotal dividend payable 17 12\nLong-term deferred revenue 8 13\nOther 15 17\nTotal long-term obligations 64 52\nLess current portion (included in other current liabilities) (11) (10)\nLong-term obligations due after one year $ 53 $ 42\nUnconditional Purchase Obligations\nIn the ordinary course of business we enter into certain unconditional purchase obligations with our suppliers. These are agreements to purchase products and services that are enforceable, legally binding, and specify terms that include fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the payments.\nAnnual minimum commitments under purchase obligations at July 31, 2021 were as shown in the table below.\n(In millions) Purchase\nObligations\nFiscal year ending July 31,\n2022 $ 205\n2023 147\n2024 68\n2025 58\n2026 53\nThereafter -\nTotal commitments $ 531\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\n9. Leases\nWe lease office facilities under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements. Our facility leases generally provide for periodic rent increases and may contain escalation clauses and renewal options. Our leases have remaining lease terms of up to 10 years, some of which include one or more options to extend the leases for up to 10 years per option, generally at rates to be determined in accordance with the agreements. Options to extend the lease are included in the lease liability if they are reasonably certain of being exercised. We do not have significant finance leases.\nWe sublease certain office facilities to third parties. These subleases have remaining lease terms of up to 4 years, some of which include one or more options to extend the subleases for up to 5 years per option.\nIn March 2020, we entered into an agreement to terminate an office facility lease and related sublease, which were due to expire in 2025 and 2022, respectively. As a result, we reduced our operating lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities by $61 million during the twelve months ended July 31, 2020.\nThe components of lease expense were as follows:\nTwelve Months Ended July 31,\n(In millions) 2021 2020\nOperating lease cost (1)\n$ 75 $ 69\nVariable lease cost 11 13\nSublease income (16) (22)\nTotal net lease cost $ 70 $ 60\n(1) Includes short-term leases, which are not significant for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021 or 2020.\nPrior to the adoption of ASC 842 on August 1, 2019, rent expense under operating leases, net of sublease income was $42 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2019. Sublease income was $24 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2019.\nSupplemental cash flow information related to operating leases was as follows:\nTwelve Months Ended July 31,\n2021 2020\n(In millions)\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities $ 76 $ 70\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities (1)\n$ 60 $ 346\n(1) For the twelve months ended July 31, 2020, this includes $319 million for operating leases existing on August 1, 2019 and $27 million for operating leases that commenced during fiscal 2020.\nOther information related to operating leases was as follows at the dates indicated:\nJuly 31,\n2021 2020\nWeighted-average remaining lease term for operating leases 6.8 years 5.5 years\nWeighted-average discount rate for operating leases 2.3 % 3.1 %\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nFuture minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases as of July 31, 2021 were as follows:\n(In millions) Operating\nLeases (1)\nFiscal year ending July 31,\n2022 $ 76\n2023 81\n2024 78\n2025 62\n2026 45\nThereafter 139\nTotal future minimum lease payments 481\nLess imputed interest (35)\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 446\n(1) Non-cancellable sublease proceeds for the fiscal years ending July 31, 2022, 2023, 2024, and 2025 of $18 million, $11 million, $8 million, and $4 million, respectively, are not included in the table above.\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to operating leases was as follows at the date indicated:\nJuly 31,\n(In millions) 2021 2020\nOperating lease right-of-use assets $ 380 $ 226\nOther current liabilities $ 66 $ 46\nOperating lease liabilities 380 221\nTotal operating lease liabilities $ 446 $ 267\nAs of July 31, 2021, we have additional operating leases of $43 million, primarily for office facilities, that have not yet commenced and therefore are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheet nor in the tables above. These operating leases will commence in fiscal year 2022 with lease terms of 1 to 11 years.\n10. Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes consisted of the following for the periods indicated:\nTwelve Months Ended July 31,\n(In millions) 2021 2020 2019\nCurrent:\nFederal $ 399 $ 372 $ 271\nState 121 79 67\nForeign 17 21 14\nTotal current 537 472 352\nDeferred:\nFederal (33) (47) (23)\nState (11) (47) (4)\nForeign 1 (6) (1)\nTotal deferred (43) (100) (28)\nTotal provision for income taxes $ 494 $ 372 $ 324\nWe recognized excess tax benefits on share-based compensation of $126 million, $90 million, and $120 million in the provision for income taxes for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nThe sources of income before the provision for income taxes consisted of the following for the periods indicated:\nTwelve Months Ended July 31,\n(In millions) 2021 2020 2019\nUnited States $ 2,497 $ 2,206 $ 1,826\nForeign 59 (8) 55\nTotal $ 2,556 $ 2,198 $ 1,881\nDifferences between income taxes calculated using the federal statutory income tax rate and the provision for income taxes were as follows for the periods indicated:\nTwelve Months Ended July 31,\n(In millions) 2021 2020 2019\nIncome before income taxes $ 2,556 $ 2,198 $ 1,881\nU.S. federal statutory rate 21 % 21 % 21 %\nStatutory federal income tax $ 537 $ 462 $ 395\nState income tax, net of federal benefit 87 25 50\nFederal research and experimentation credits (70) (54) (48)\nShare-based compensation 38 22 15\nFederal excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation (105) (79) (106)\nEffects of non-U.S. operations 4 13 13\nOther, net 3 (17) 5\nTotal provision for income taxes $ 494 $ 372 $ 324\nThe state income tax line in the table above includes excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation of $21 million, $11 million and $14 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nIn the current global tax policy environment, the U.S. and other domestic and foreign governments continue to consider, and in some cases enact, changes in corporate tax laws. As changes occur, we account for finalized legislation in the period of enactment.\nSignificant deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows at the dates indicated:\nJuly 31,\n(In millions) 2021 2020\nDeferred tax assets:\nAccruals and reserves not currently deductible $ 48 $ 23\nOperating lease liabilities 113 64\nAccrued and deferred compensation 132 112\nLoss and tax credit carryforwards 282 114\nIntangible assets 33 26\nShare-based compensation 59 44\nOther, net 16 13\nTotal gross deferred tax assets 683 396\nValuation allowance (205) (132)\nTotal deferred tax assets 478 264\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nDeferred revenue 32 68\nOperating lease right-of-use assets 96 55\nIntangibles 844 45\nProperty and equipment 10 22\nOther, net 13 11\nTotal deferred tax liabilities 995 201\nNet deferred tax assets (liabilities) $ (517) $ 63\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nThe components of total net deferred tax assets (liabilities), net of valuation allowances, as shown on our consolidated balance sheets were as follows at the dates indicated:\nJuly 31,\n(In millions) 2021 2020\nLong-term deferred income taxes $ 8 $ 65\nLong-term deferred income tax liabilities (525) (2)\nNet deferred tax assets (liabilities) $ (517) $ 63\nWe have provided a valuation allowance related to state research and experimentation tax credit carryforwards, foreign loss carryforwards, foreign intangible deferred tax assets and state operating and capital loss carryforwards that we believe are unlikely to be realized. Changes in the valuation allowance during the twelve months ended July 31, 2021 and July 31, 2020 were primarily related to state research and experimentation tax credit carryforwards, foreign intangible deferred tax assets and foreign loss carryforwards.\nAt July 31, 2021, we had total federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $216 million that will start to expire in fiscal 2033. Utilization of the net operating losses is subject to annual limitation. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization.\nAt July 31, 2021, we had total state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $304 million for which we have recorded a deferred tax asset of $17 million and a valuation allowance of $4 million. The state net operating loss carryforwards will start to expire in fiscal 2022. Utilization of the net operating losses is subject to annual limitation. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization.\nAt July 31, 2021, we had United Kingdom operating loss carryforwards of approximately $67 million, Singapore operating loss carryforwards of approximately $63 million, Brazil operating loss carryforwards of approximately $59 million and Australia operating loss carryforwards of $2 million which have an indefinite carryforward period. We maintain a full valuation allowance with respect to operating losses in Singapore, Brazil and United Kingdom jurisdictions, as there is not sufficient evidence of future sources of taxable income required to utilize such carryforwards.\nAt July 31, 2021, we had federal research and experimentation credit carryforwards of approximately $71 million that will start to expire in fiscal 2036. Utilization of the federal research and experimentation credit is subject to annual limitation. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of the Federal research and experimentation credit before utilization.\nAt July 31, 2021, we had California research and experimentation credit carryforwards of approximately $227 million. The California research and experimentation credit will carryforward indefinitely. We recorded a full valuation on the related deferred tax asset, as we believe it is more likely than not that these credits will not be utilized.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nThe aggregate changes in the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits were as follows for the periods indicated:\nTwelve Months Ended July 31,\n(In millions) 2021 2020 2019\nGross unrecognized tax benefits, beginning balance $ 101 $ 120 $ 90\nIncreases related to tax positions from prior fiscal years, including acquisitions 69 2 13\nDecreases related to tax positions from prior fiscal years - (35) -\nIncreases related to tax positions taken during current fiscal year 31 21 23\nSettlements with tax authorities - (1) (1)\nLapse of statute of limitations (11) (6) (5)\nGross unrecognized tax benefits, ending balance $ 190 $ 101 $ 120\nThe total amount of our unrecognized tax benefits at July 31, 2021 was $190 million. If we were to recognize these net benefits, our income tax expense would reflect a favorable net impact of $109 million. The increase in the unrecognized tax benefits related to prior years includes $41 million of unrecognized tax benefits from the Credit Karma acquisition. We do not believe that it is reasonably possible that there will be a significant increase or decrease in unrecognized tax benefits over the next 12 months.\nWe file U.S. federal, U.S. state, and foreign tax returns. Our major tax jurisdictions are the U.S. federal jurisdiction and California. For U.S. federal tax returns, we are no longer subject to tax examinations for fiscal 2017 and for years prior to fiscal 2016. For California tax returns, we are no longer subject to tax examination for years prior to fiscal 2016.\nWe recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes. Amounts accrued at July 31, 2021 and July 31, 2020 for the payment of interest and penalties were not significant. The amounts of\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\ninterest and penalties that we recognized during the twelve months ended July 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were also not significant.\nWe have offset a $75 million long-term liability for uncertain tax positions against our long-term income tax receivable at July 31, 2021. We have offset a $59 million long-term income tax receivable against our long-term liability for uncertain tax positions at July 31, 2020. The long-term income tax receivable at July 31, 2021 was primarily related to the government\u2019s approval of a method of accounting change request for fiscal 2018 and a refund claim related to Credit Karma\u2019s alternative minimum tax credit that was recorded as part of the acquisition. The long-term income tax receivable at July 31, 2020 was primarily related to the method of accounting change request.\n11. Stockholders\u2019 Equity\nStock Repurchase Programs\nIntuit\u2019s Board of Directors has authorized a series of common stock repurchase programs. Shares of common stock repurchased under these programs become treasury shares. Under these programs, we repurchased 2.4 million shares of our common stock for $1.0 billion during the twelve months ended July 31, 2021. Included in this amount were $17 million of repurchases which occurred in late July 2021 and settled in August 2021. At July 31, 2021, we had authorization from our Board of Directors to expend up to an additional $1.3 billion for stock repurchases. On August 20, 2021 our Board approved a new stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to an additional $2 billion of our common stock. Future stock repurchases under the current program are at the discretion of management, and authorization of future stock repurchase programs is subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.\nOur treasury shares are repurchased at the market price on the trade date; accordingly, all amounts paid to reacquire these shares have been recorded as treasury stock on our consolidated balance sheets. Repurchased shares of our common stock are held as treasury shares until they are reissued or retired. When we reissue treasury stock, if the proceeds from the sale are more than the average price we paid to acquire the shares we record an increase in additional paid-in capital. Conversely, if the proceeds from the sale are less than the average price we paid to acquire the shares, we record a decrease in additional paid-in capital to the extent of increases previously recorded for similar transactions and a decrease in retained earnings for any remaining amount.\nIn the past we have satisfied option exercises and restricted stock unit vesting under our employee equity incentive plans by reissuing treasury shares, and we may do so again in the future. During the second quarter of fiscal 2014 we began issuing new shares of common stock to satisfy option exercises and RSU vesting under our 2005 Equity Incentive Plan. We have not yet determined the ultimate disposition of the shares that we have repurchased in the past, and consequently we continue to hold them as treasury shares.\nDividends on Common Stock\nDuring fiscal 2021 we declared cash dividends that totaled $2.36 per share of outstanding common stock or approximately $651 million. In August 2021 our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.68 per share of outstanding common stock payable on October 18, 2021 to stockholders of record at the close of business on October 11, 2021. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record dates and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.\nDescription of 2005 Equity Incentive Plan and Credit Karma, Inc. 2015 Equity Incentive Plan\nOur stockholders initially approved our 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (2005 Plan) on December 9, 2004. On January 19, 2017 our stockholders approved an Amended and Restated 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (Restated 2005 Plan) that expires on January 19, 2027. Under the Restated 2005 Plan, we are permitted to grant incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units (RSUs), stock appreciation rights and stock bonus awards to our employees, non-employee directors, and consultants. The Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of our Board of Directors or its delegates determine who will receive grants, when those grants will be exercisable, their exercise price and other terms. We are permitted to issue up to 138.1 million shares under the Restated 2005 Plan. The plan provides a fungible share reserve. Each stock option granted on or after November 1, 2010 reduces the share reserve by one share and each restricted stock award or restricted stock unit granted reduces the share reserve by 2.3 shares. Stock options forfeited and returned to the pool of shares available for grant increase the pool by one share for each share forfeited. Restricted stock awards and RSUs forfeited and returned to the pool of shares available for grant increase the pool by 2.3 shares for each share forfeited. Shares withheld for income taxes upon vesting of RSUs that were granted on or after July 21, 2016 are also returned to the pool of shares available for grant. Stock options granted under the 2005 Plan and the Restated 2005 Plan typically vest over three to four years based on continued service and have a seven year term. RSUs granted under those plans typically vest over three to four years based on continued service. Certain RSUs granted to senior management vest based on the achievement of pre-established performance or market goals.\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nIn connection with our acquisition of Credit Karma on December 3, 2020, we assumed the Credit Karma, Inc. 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (Credit Karma Plan), under which the assumed equity awards were granted. The assumed equity awards will be settled in shares of our common stock and will retain the terms and conditions under which they were originally granted. See Note 6, \"Business Combinations,\" for more information on the Credit Karma acquisition and the related equity awards assumed.\nOn December 3, 2020, we filed a Form S-8 to register a total of 4,298,127 shares of common stock. This includes 1,997,881 shares of common stock that are issuable upon vesting of assumed equity awards and 2,300,246 shares that are available for issuance under the Credit Karma Plan. The plan provides a fungible share reserve. Each restricted stock unit granted reduces the share reserve by one share. RSUs forfeited and returned to the pool of shares available for grant increase the pool by one share for each share forfeited. Shares withheld for income taxes upon vesting of RSUs are also returned to the pool of shares available for grant. New RSUs granted under the Credit Karma Plan typically vest over four years based on continued service.\nAt July 31, 2021, there were approximately 16.9 million shares available for grant under the Restated 2005 Plan and Credit Karma Plan.\nDescription of Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nOn November 26, 1996 our stockholders initially adopted our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. The ESPP permits our eligible employees to make payroll deductions to purchase our stock on regularly scheduled purchase dates at a discount. Our stockholders have approved amendments to the ESPP to permit the issuance of up to 23.8 million shares under the ESPP, which expires upon the earliest to occur of (a) termination of the ESPP by the Board, or (b) issuance of all the shares of Intuit\u2019s common stock reserved for issuance under the ESPP. Offering periods under the ESPP are six months in duration and composed of two consecutive three-month accrual periods. Shares are purchased at 85% of the lower of the closing price for Intuit common stock on the first day of the offering period or the last day of the accrual period.\nUnder the ESPP, employees purchased 405,268 shares of Intuit common stock during the twelve months ended July 31, 2021; 449,999 shares during the twelve months ended July 31, 2020; and 485,011 shares during the twelve months ended July 31, 2019. At July 31, 2021, there were 1,050,916 shares available for issuance under this plan.\nShare-Based Compensation Expense\nThe following table summarizes the total share-based compensation expense that we recorded in operating income for the periods shown.\nTwelve Months Ended July 31,\n(In millions except per share amounts) 2021 2020 2019\nCost of product revenue $ 1 $ 1 $ 1\nCost of service and other revenue 68 59 57\nSelling and marketing 183 116 103\nResearch and development 281 151 136\nGeneral and administrative 220 108 104\nTotal share-based compensation expense 753 435 401\nIncome tax benefit (269) (173) (200)\nDecrease in net income $ 484 $ 262 $ 201\nDecrease in net income per share:\nBasic $ 1.79 $ 1.00 $ 0.77\nDiluted $ 1.77 $ 0.99 $ 0.76\nWe capitalized $2 million, $3 million, and $4 million in share-based compensation related to internal use software projects during the twelve months ended July 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.\nDetermining Fair Value\nValuation and Amortization Methods\nRestricted stock units (RSUs) granted typically vest based on continued service. We value these time-based RSUs at the date of grant using the intrinsic value method. We amortize the fair value of time-based RSUs on a straight-line basis over the service period. These time-based RSUs accounted for approximately 80% of our total share-based compensation expense during the twelve months ended July 31, 2021. Certain RSUs granted to senior management vest based on the achievement of pre-established performance or market goals. We estimate the fair value of performance-based RSUs at the date of grant using the\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nintrinsic value method and the probability that the specified performance criteria will be met. Each quarter we update our assessment of the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved and adjust our estimate of the fair value of the performance-based RSUs if necessary. We amortize the fair values of performance-based RSUs over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award. We estimate the fair value of market-based RSUs at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation methodology and amortize those fair values over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award. The Monte Carlo methodology that we use to estimate the fair value of market-based RSUs at the date of grant incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied. Provided that the requisite service is rendered, the total fair value of the market-based RSUs at the date of grant must be recognized as compensation expense even if the market condition is not achieved. However, the number of shares that ultimately vest can vary significantly with the performance of the specified market criteria. All of the RSUs we grant have dividend rights that are subject to the same vesting requirements as the underlying equity awards, so we do not adjust the market price of our stock on the date of grant for dividends.\nWe estimate the fair value of stock options granted using a lattice binomial model and a multiple option award approach. Our stock options have various restrictions, including vesting provisions and restrictions on transfer, and are often exercised prior to their contractual maturity. We believe that lattice binomial models are more capable of incorporating the features of our stock options than closed-form models such as the Black Scholes model. The use of a lattice binomial model requires the use of extensive actual employee exercise behavior and a number of complex assumptions including the expected volatility of our stock price over the term of the options, risk-free interest rates and expected dividends. We amortize the fair value of options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods.\nExpected Term. The expected term of options granted represents the period of time that they are expected to be outstanding and is a derived output of the lattice binomial model. The expected term of stock options is impacted by all of the underlying assumptions and calibration of our model. The lattice binomial model assumes that option exercise behavior is a function of the option\u2019s remaining vested life and the extent to which the market price of our common stock exceeds the option exercise price. The lattice binomial model estimates the probability of exercise as a function of these two variables based on the history of exercises and cancellations on all past option grants made by us.\nExpected Volatility. We estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the implied volatility of one-year and two-year publicly traded options on our common stock. Our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility.\nRisk-Free Interest Rate. We base the risk-free interest rate that we use in our option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on constant maturity U.S. Treasury issues with equivalent remaining terms.\nDividends. We use an annualized expected dividend yield in our option valuation model. We paid quarterly cash dividends during all years presented and currently expect to continue to pay cash dividends in the future.\nForfeitures. We adjust share-based compensation expense for actual forfeitures as they occur.\nWe used the following assumptions to estimate the fair value of stock options granted and shares purchased under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan for the periods indicated:\nTwelve Months Ended July 31,\n2021 2020 2019\nAssumptions for stock options:\nExpected volatility (range) 29 % 32 % 26% - 27%\nWeighted average expected volatility 29 % 32 % 27 %\nRisk-free interest rate (range) 0.62 % 0.20 % 1.84% - 2.92%\nExpected dividend yield 0.45 % 0.70 % 0.67% - 0.85%\nAssumptions for ESPP:\nExpected volatility (range) 31% - 36%\n23% - 72%\n21% - 33%\nWeighted average expected volatility 34 % 39 % 26 %\nRisk-free interest rate (range) 0.02% - 0.17%\n0.24% - 2.23%\n1.94% - 2.44%\nExpected dividend yield 0.60% - 0.75%\n0.74% - 0.95%\n0.73% - 0.95%\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nShare-Based Awards Available for Grant\nA summary of share-based awards available for grant under our plans for the fiscal periods indicated was as follows:\n(Shares in thousands) Shares\nAvailable\nfor Grant\nBalance at July 31, 2018 22,791\nRestricted stock units granted (1)\n(5,639)\nOptions granted (487)\nShare-based awards canceled/forfeited/expired (1)(2)\n4,393\nBalance at July 31, 2019 21,058\nRestricted stock units granted (1)\n(6,111)\nOptions granted (382)\nShare-based awards canceled/forfeited/expired (1)(2)\n3,482\nBalance at July 31, 2020 18,047\nShares available for grant under the Credit Karma Plan 4,298\nRestricted stock units granted (1)\n(9,191)\nOptions granted (323)\nShare-based awards canceled/forfeited/expired (1)(2)\n4,020\nBalance at July 31, 2021 16,851\n(1)RSUs granted from the pool of shares available for grant under our 2005 Equity Incentive Plan reduce the pool by 2.3 shares for each share granted.

Benefit Plans\nNon-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan\nIntuit\u2019s Executive Deferred Compensation Plan provides that executives who meet minimum compensation requirements are eligible to defer up to 75% of their salaries and up to 75% of their bonuses. We have agreed to credit the participants\u2019 contributions with earnings that reflect the performance of certain independent investment funds. We do not guarantee above-market interest on account balances. We may also make discretionary employer contributions to participant accounts in certain circumstances. The timing, amounts, and vesting schedules of employer contributions are at the sole discretion of the Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of our Board of Directors or its delegate. The benefits under this plan are unsecured and are general assets of Intuit. Participants are generally eligible to receive payment of their vested benefit at the end of their elected deferral period or after termination of their employment with Intuit for any reason or at a later date to comply with the restrictions of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. Participants may elect to receive their payments in a lump sum or installments. Discretionary company contributions and the related earnings vest completely upon the participant\u2019s disability, death, or a change in control of Intuit. We made no employer contributions to the plan for any period presented.\nWe had liabilities related to this plan of $153 million at July 31, 2021 and $123 million at July 31, 2020. We have matched the plan liabilities with similar-performing assets, which are primarily investments in life insurance contracts. These assets are recorded in other long-term assets while liabilities related to obligations are recorded in other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.\n401(k) Plans\nIn the United States, employees who participate in the Intuit Inc. 401(k) Plan may currently contribute up to 50% of pre-tax compensation, subject to Internal Revenue Service limitations and the terms and conditions of the plan. We match a portion of employee contributions, currently 125% up to six percent of salary, subject to Internal Revenue Service limitations.\nAdditionally, Credit Karma employees in the United States who participate in the Credit Karma 401(k) Plan may currently contribute up to 90% of pre-tax compensation, subject to Internal Revenue Service limitations and the terms and conditions of the plan. We match a portion of Credit Karma employee contributions, currently 100% up to six percent of salary, subject to Internal Revenue Service limitations.\nMatching contributions for both plans were $80 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021; $69 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2020; and $59 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2019.\n13. Litigation\nBeginning in May 2019, various legal proceedings were filed and certain regulatory inquiries were commenced in connection with our provision and marketing of free online tax preparation programs. We believe that the allegations contained within these legal proceedings are without merit. We are vigorously defending our interests in the legal proceedings and cooperating in the inquiries. These proceedings include, among others, multiple putative class actions that were consolidated into a single putative class action in the Northern District of California in September 2019 (the \u201cIntuit Free File Litigation\u201d) and demands for arbitration that were filed beginning in October 2019. In August 2020, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ordered that the putative class action claims be resolved through arbitration. Intuit entered into a proposed settlement agreement in November 2020 to resolve the putative class action, which was rejected by the court. On May 20, 2021, Intuit entered into an agreement\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nthat resolved the Intuit Free File Litigation on an individual non-class basis, without any admission of wrongdoing, for a non-material amount and, on May 26, 2021, it was dismissed on a non-class basis.\nIn June 2021, Intuit received a demand and draft complaint from the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) and certain state attorneys general relating to the ongoing inquiries described above. Although we believe that the allegations contained therein are without merit, if we are not able to reach a resolution, the FTC and one or more state attorneys general may seek resolution through litigation. The defense and resolution of this matter could involve significant costs to us.\nAs of July 31, 2021, there were approximately 126,000 individual arbitration claims pending and we could incur significant arbitration and legal fees associated with the defense of these claims. We recorded approximately $14 million in arbitration fees related to these claims in fiscal 2020. The amount of our fiscal 2021 arbitration fees net of insurance proceeds and rebates was not material. The arbitration fees are unrelated to the underlying merits of the claims and are accrued at the earlier of when invoiced or when the services are rendered. We could incur additional arbitration fees of approximately $360 million in future periods. We are continuing to dispute the applicability and propriety of these fees. An immaterial number of claims have been resolved through the arbitration process to date and we expect that more claims will continue through the process.\nIn view of the complexity and ongoing and uncertain nature of the outstanding proceedings and inquiries, at this time we are unable to estimate a reasonably possible financial loss or range of financial loss that we may incur to resolve or settle the remaining matters.\nTo date, the legal and other fees we have incurred related to these proceedings and inquiries have not been material. The ongoing defense and any resolution or settlement of these proceedings and inquiries could involve significant costs to us.\nIntuit is subject to certain routine legal proceedings, including class action lawsuits, as well as demands, claims, government inquiries and threatened litigation, that arise in the normal course of our business, including assertions that we may be infringing patents or other intellectual property rights of others. Our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights, or litigation arising out of intellectual property claims could adversely affect our business. We currently believe that, in addition to any amounts accrued, the amount of potential losses, if any, for any pending claims of any type (either alone or combined) will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The ultimate outcome of any legal proceeding is uncertain and, regardless of outcome, legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on Intuit because of defense costs, negative publicity, diversion of management resources and other factors.\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\n14. Segment Information\nWe have defined four reportable segments, described below, based on factors such as how we manage our operations and how our chief operating decision maker views results. We define the chief operating decision maker as our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. Our chief operating decision maker organizes and manages our business primarily on the basis of product and service offerings.\nIn August 2020, we reorganized certain technology and customer success functions that support and benefit our overall platform. Additionally, certain legal, facility and employee service costs are now managed at the corporate level. As a result, these costs are no longer included in segment operating income and are now included in other corporate expenses. For the twelve months ended July 31, 2020 and 2019, we reclassified $180 million and $172 million from Small Business & Self-Employed, $121 million and $78 million from Consumer, and $13 million and $12 million from ProConnect to other corporate expenses. In August 2020, we also renamed our Strategic Partner segment as the ProConnect segment. This segment continues to serve professional accountants.\nIn December 2020 we acquired Credit Karma in a business combination and it operates as a separate reportable segment. We have included the results of operations of Credit Karma in our consolidated statements of operations from the date of acquisition. See Note 6, \"Business Combinations,\" for more information. Segment operating income for Credit Karma includes all direct expenses, which is different from our other reportable segments where we do not fully allocate corporate expenses.\nSmall Business & Self-Employed: This segment serves small businesses and the self-employed around the world, and the accounting professionals who assist and advise them. Our offerings include QuickBooks financial and business management online services and desktop software, payroll solutions, merchant payment processing solutions, and financing for small businesses.\nConsumer: This segment serves consumers and includes do-it-yourself and assisted TurboTax income tax preparation products and services sold in the U.S. and Canada. Our Mint offering is a personal finance offering which helps customers track their finances and daily financial behaviors.\nCredit Karma: This segment serves consumers with a personal finance platform that provides personalized recommendations of credit card, home, auto and personal loan, and insurance products; online savings and checking accounts through an FDIC member bank partner; and access to their credit scores and reports, credit and identity monitoring, credit report dispute, and data-driven resources.\nProConnect: This segment serves professional accountants in the U.S. and Canada, who are essential to both small business success and tax preparation and filing. Our professional tax offerings include Lacerte, ProSeries, and ProConnect Tax Online in the U.S., and ProFile and ProTax Online in Canada.\nAll of our segments operate primarily in the United States and sell primarily to customers in the United States. Total international net revenue was less than 5% of consolidated total net revenue for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nFor our Small Business & Self-Employed, Consumer, and ProConnect reportable segments, we include expenses such as corporate selling and marketing, product development and general and administrative, which are not allocated to specific segments, in unallocated corporate items as part of other corporate expenses. For our Credit Karma reportable segment, segment expenses include all direct expenses related to selling and marketing, product development, and general and administrative. Unallocated corporate items for all segments include share-based compensation, amortization of acquired technology, amortization of other acquired intangible assets, and goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges.\nThe accounting policies of our reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in Note 1. Except for goodwill and purchased intangible assets, we do not generally track assets by reportable segment and, consequently, we do not disclose total assets by reportable segment. See Note 5, \u201cGoodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets,\u201d for goodwill by reportable segment.\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents\nThe following table shows our financial results by reportable segment for the periods indicated.\nTwelve Months Ended July 31,\n(In millions) 2021 2020 2019\nNet revenue:\nSmall Business & Self-Employed $ 4,688 $ 4,050 $ 3,533\nConsumer 3,563 3,136 2,775\nCredit Karma 865 - -\nProConnect 517 493 476\nTotal net revenue $ 9,633 $ 7,679 $ 6,784\nOperating income:\nSmall Business & Self-Employed $ 2,590 $ 2,091 $ 1,722\nConsumer 2,237 2,063 1,820\nCredit Karma 182 - -\nProConnect 372 346 330\nTotal segment operating income 5,381 4,500 3,872\nUnallocated corporate items:\nShare-based compensation expense (753) (435) (401)\nOther corporate expenses (1,932) (1,861) (1,591)\nAmortization of acquired technology (50) (22) (20)\nAmortization of other acquired intangible assets (146) (6) (6)\nTotal unallocated corporate items (2,881) (2,324) (2,018)\nTotal operating income $ 2,500 $ 2,176 $ 1,854\nRevenue classified by significant product and service offerings was as follows:\nTwelve Months Ended July 31,\n(In millions) 2021 2020 2019\nNet revenue:\nQuickBooks Online Accounting $ 1,699 $ 1,354 $ 980\nOnline Services 1,051 828 683\nTotal Online Ecosystem 2,750 2,182 1,663\nQuickBooks Desktop Accounting 789 755 732\nDesktop Services and Supplies 1,149 1,113 1,138\nTotal Desktop Ecosystem 1,938 1,868 1,870\nSmall Business & Self-Employed 4,688 4,050 3,533\nConsumer 3,563 3,136 2,775\nCredit Karma 865 - -\nProConnect 517 493 476\nTotal net revenue $ 9,633 $ 7,679 $ 6,784\nRevenue from our QuickBooks Desktop packaged software products was $133 million, $147 million, and $167 million for the twelve months ended July 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.

    "item_9A": "ITEM 9A - CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nBased upon an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures, Intuit\u2019s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K our disclosure controls and procedures as defined under Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission and is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2021 based on the guidelines established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn accordance with guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their final assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the first fiscal year in which the acquisition occurred. Our management\u2019s evaluation of internal control over financial reporting excluded the internal control activities of Credit Karma, which we acquired on December 3, 2020, as discussed in Note 6, \u201cBusiness Combinations\u201d, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We have included the financial results of this acquisition in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Total revenue and net income subject to Credit Karma\u2019s internal control over financial reporting represented nine percent of both our consolidated total revenues and net income for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021. Total assets and net assets subject to Credit Karma\u2019s internal control over financial reporting represent approximately nine percent of both our consolidated total assets and net assets, excluding acquisition fair value adjustments, as of July 31, 2021.\nBased on the results of our evaluation, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of July 31, 2021 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We reviewed the results of management\u2019s assessment with the Audit and Risk Committee of Intuit\u2019s Board of Directors.\nErnst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2021. Their report is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nExcept as noted above, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the period ended July 31, 2021 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and that they are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, no matter how well conceived and executed, a control system can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. The design of any control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. There are also limitations that are inherent in any control system. These limitations include the realities that breakdowns can occur because of errors in judgment or mistakes, and that controls can be circumvented by individual persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. Because of these inherent limitations in a cost effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nIntuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K\nTables of Contents",
