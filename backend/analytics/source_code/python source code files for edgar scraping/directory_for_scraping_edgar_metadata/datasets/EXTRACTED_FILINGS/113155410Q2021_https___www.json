Description of Business\nGeneral\nSynchronoss Technologies, Inc. (\u201cSynchronoss\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) Digital, Cloud, Messaging and Total Network Management platforms help the world\u2019s leading companies, including operators, original equipment manufacturers (\u201cOEMs\u201d), and Media and Technology providers to deliver continuously transformative customer experiences that create high value engagement and new monetization opportunities.\nThe Company currently operates in and markets solutions and services directly through the Company\u2019s sales organizations in North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. The Company\u2019s platforms give customers new opportunities in the Telecommunications, Media and Technology (\u201cTMT\u201d) space, taking advantage of the rapidly converging services, connected devices, networks and applications.\nThe Company delivers platforms, products and solutions including:\n\u2022White Label Personal Cloud: Cloud sync, backup, storage, device set up, content transfer and content engagement for user generated content.\n\u2022Messaging: White label consumer email solutions. Advanced, multi-channel messaging peer-to-peer (\u201cP2P\u201d) communications and application-to-person (\u201cA2P\u201d) commerce solutions.\n\u2022Digital: Customer journey and workflow design, development, orchestration and experience management.\n\u2022Total Network Management (\u201cTNM\u201d): integrated application suite that designs, procures, manages and optimizes telecom network infrastructure.\nThe Synchronoss Personal Cloud\u2122 platform is a secure and highly scalable white label platform designed to store and sync subscriber\u2019s personally created content seamlessly to and from current and new devices. This allows a carrier\u2019s customers to protect, engage with and manage their personal content and gives the Company\u2019s Operator customers the ability to increase average revenue per user (\u201cARPU\u201d) through a new monthly recurring charge (\u201cMRC\u201d) and opportunities to mine valuable data that will give subscribers access to new, beneficial services. Additionally, the Company\u2019s Personal Cloud Platform performs an expanding set of value-add services including facilitating an Operator\u2019s initial device setup and enhancing visibility and control across disparate devices within subscribers\u2019 smart homes.\nThe Synchronoss Messaging Platform powers hundreds of millions of subscribers\u2019 mail boxes worldwide. The Company\u2019s Advanced Messaging Product is a powerful, secure and intelligent white label messaging platform that expands capabilities for Operators and TMT companies to offer P2P messaging via Rich Communications Services (\u201cRCS\u201d). Additionally, the Company\u2019s Advanced Messaging Product powers commerce and a robust ecosystem for Operators, brands and advertisers to execute Application to Person (\u201cA2P\u201d) commerce and data-rich dialogue with subscribers.\nThe Synchronoss Digital Platform is a suite of technology, tools and solutions that includes digital experience creation and management, automated provisioning, artificial intelligence and financial analytics that service a broad array of TMT markets. The products equip customers with a toolkit of capabilities where they can design, deploy and manage end user customer journeys and workflows easily and quickly from one central platform that also integrates across front end customer engagement channels as well as enterprise business systems (e.g. CRM, POS) allowing non-citizen developers to configure rather than code experiences. The platform sits between customer-facing touch points and a customer\u2019s existing back-office systems to orchestrate data, workflows and processes into digital customer journeys that interface with end user channels creating user experiences that can be centrally managed and coordinated with less resources than is typical in a traditional IT environment.\nThe Synchronoss Total Network Management application suite provides Operators with the tools and software to design their physical network, streamline their infrastructure purchases, and comprehensive network expense optimization and management for leading top tier carriers around the globe.\nTable of Content\nSYNCHRONOSS TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - UNAUDITED\n(Amounts in tables in thousands, except for per share data or unless otherwise noted)\n2. Basis of Presentation and Consolidation\nBasis of Presentation and Consolidation\nThe accompanying interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by Synchronoss and in the opinion of management, include all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods. They do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) for complete financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the Company\u2019s audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2021.\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities (\u201cVIE\u201d) in which the Company is the primary beneficiary and entities in which the Company has a controlling interest. Investments in less than majority-owned companies in which the Company does not have a controlling interest, but does have significant influence, are accounted for as equity method investments. Investments in less than majority-owned companies in which the Company does not have the ability to exert significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee are accounted for using the cost method. All material intercompany transactions and accounts are eliminated in consolidation.\nFor further information about the Company\u2019s basis of presentation and consolidation or its significant accounting policies, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nRisks and Uncertainties\nThere continue to be uncertainties regarding the current coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") pandemic, and the Company is closely monitoring the impact of the pandemic on all aspects of its business, including how it will impact its customers, employees, suppliers, vendors, business partners and distribution channels. While the pandemic did not materially affect the Company\u2019s financial results and business operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, the Company is unable to predict the impact that COVID-19 will have on its financial position and operating results due to numerous uncertainties. The Company will continue to assess the evolving impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and will make adjustments to its operations as necessary.\nTable of Content\nSYNCHRONOSS TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - UNAUDITED\n(Amounts in tables in thousands, except for per share data or unless otherwise noted)\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nRecent accounting pronouncements adopted\nStandard Description Effect on the financial statements\nUpdate 2019-12 - Income Taxes (Topic 740) Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes The ASU removes the exception to the general principles in ASC 740, Income Taxes, associated with the incremental approach for intra-period tax allocation, accounting for basis differences when there are ownership changes in foreign investments and interim-period income tax accounting for year-to-date losses that exceed anticipated losses. In addition, the ASU improves the application of income tax related guidance and simplifies U.S. GAAP when accounting for franchise taxes that are partially based on income, transactions with government resulting in a step-up in tax basis goodwill, separate financial statements of legal entities not subject to tax, and enacted changes in tax laws in interim periods. Different transition approaches, retrospective, modified retrospective, or prospective, will apply to each income tax simplification provision. The Company adopted the new standard as of January 1, 2021. The standard did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial position or results of operations upon adoption.\nDate of adoption: January 1, 2021.\nStandards issued not yet adopted\nStandard Description Effect on the financial statements\nUpdate 2020-06, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity (ASU 2020-06) The ASU simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by reducing the number of accounting models available for convertible debt instruments. This guidance also eliminates the treasury stock method to calculate diluted earnings per share for convertible instruments and requires the use of the if-converted method. This guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2022 on a full or modified retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nDate of adoption: January 1, 2022.\nTable of Content\nSYNCHRONOSS TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - UNAUDITED\n(Amounts in tables in thousands, except for per share data or unless otherwise noted)\n3. Revenue\nDisaggregation of revenue\nThe Company disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers into the nature of the products and services and geographical regions. The Company\u2019s geographic regions are the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa (\u201cEMEA\u201d), and Asia Pacific (\u201cAPAC\u201d).

A receivable is a right to consideration that is unconditional (i.e. only the passage of time is required before payment is due). For example, the Company recognizes a receivable for revenues related to its time and materials and transaction or volume-based contracts. The Company presents such receivables in Trade accounts receivable, net in its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position at their net estimated realizable value. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses to provide\nTable of Content\nSYNCHRONOSS TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - UNAUDITED\n(Amounts in tables in thousands, except for per share data or unless otherwise noted)\nfor the estimated amount of receivables that may not be collected. The allowance is based upon an assessment of customer creditworthiness, historical payment experience, the age of outstanding receivables and other economic indicators.\nA contract asset is a right to consideration that is conditional upon factors other than the passage of time. For example, the Company would record a contract asset if it records revenue on a professional services engagement but are not entitled to bill until the Company achieves specified milestones. Contract assets balance at September 30, 2021 is $7.5 million.\nAmounts collected in advance of services being provided are accounted for as contract liabilities, which are presented as deferred revenue on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and are realized with the associated revenue recognized under the contract. Nearly all of the Company's contract liabilities balance is related to services revenue, primarily subscription services contracts.\nThe Company\u2019s contract assets and liabilities are reported in a net position on a customer basis at the end of each reporting period.\nSignificant changes in the contract liabilities balance (current and non-current) during the period are as follows:\nContract Liabilities1\nBalance - January 1, 2021 $ 45,614\nRevenue recognized in the period (207,027)\nAmounts billed but not recognized as revenue 193,764\nBalance - September 30, 2021 $ 32,351\n________________________________\n1 Comprised of Deferred Revenue\nTransaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations\nTopic 606 requires that the Company disclose the aggregate amount of transaction price that is allocated to performance obligations that have not yet been satisfied as of September 30, 2021. The Company has elected not to disclose transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations for:\n1.Contracts with an original duration of one year or less, including contracts that can be terminated for convenience without a substantive penalty;\n2.Contracts for which the Company recognizes revenues based on the right to invoice for services performed;\n3.Variable consideration allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied performance obligation or to a wholly unsatisfied promise to transfer a distinct good or service that forms part of a single performance obligation in accordance with Topic 606 Section 10-25-14(b), for which the criteria in Topic 606 Section 10-32-40 have been met. This applies to a limited number of situations where the Company is dependent upon data from a third party or where fees are highly variable.\nMany of the Company\u2019s performance obligations meet one or more of these exemptions. Specifically, the Company has excluded the following from the Company\u2019s remaining performance obligations, all of which will be resolved in the period in which amounts are known:\n\u2022consideration for future transactions, above any contractual minimums\n\u2022consideration for success-based transactions contingent on third party data\n\u2022credits for failure to meet future service level requirements\nAs of September 30, 2021, the aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations, other than those meeting the exclusion criteria above, was $240.4 million, of which approximately 85.5 percent is expected to be recognized as revenues within 2 years, and the remainder thereafter.\nTable of Content\nSYNCHRONOSS TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - UNAUDITED\n(Amounts in tables in thousands, except for per share data or unless otherwise noted)\nEstimates of revenue expected to be recognized in future periods also exclude unexercised customer options to purchase services that do not represent material rights to the customer. Customer options that do not represent a material right are only accounted for in accordance with Topic 606 when the customer exercises its option to purchase additional goods or services.\n4. Fair Value Measurements\nIn accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A three-level hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value as follows:\n\u2022Level 1 - Observable inputs - quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities;\n\u2022Level 2 - Observable inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities includes quoted prices for similar instruments, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in inactive markets, and amounts derived from valuation models where all significant inputs are observable in active markets; and\n\u2022Level 3 - Unobservable inputs - includes amounts derived from valuation models where one or more significant inputs are unobservable and require the Company to develop relevant assumptions.\nThe following is a summary of assets, liabilities and redeemable noncontrolling interests and their related classifications under the fair value hierarchy:\nSeptember 30, 2021\nTotal (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nAssets\nCash and cash equivalents1\n$ 24,141 $ 24,141 $ - $ -\nTotal assets $ 24,141 $ 24,141 $ - $ -\nTemporary equity\nRedeemable noncontrolling interests2\n$ 12,500 $ - $ - $ 12,500\nTotal temporary equity $ 12,500 $ - $ - $ 12,500\nDecember 31, 2020\nTotal (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nAssets\nCash and cash equivalents1\n$ 33,671 $ 33,671 $ - $ -\nTotal assets $ 33,671 $ 33,671 $ - $ -\nTemporary Equity\nRedeemable noncontrolling interests2\n$ 12,500 $ - $ - $ 12,500\nTotal temporary equity $ 12,500 $ - $ - $ 12,500\n________________________________\n1 Cash equivalents includes money market funds.\n2 Put arrangements held by the noncontrolling interests in certain of the Company\u2019s joint ventures.\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interests\nThe redeemable noncontrolling interests recorded at fair value are put arrangements held by the noncontrolling interests in certain of the Company\u2019s joint ventures. The Company recognizes changes in the redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest to the greater of the estimated redemption value, which approximates fair value, at the end of each reporting period or the initial carrying amount.\nThe fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests was estimated by applying an income approach using a discounted cash flow analysis. This fair value measurement is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement. Significant changes in the underlying assumptions used to value the redeemable\nTable of Content\nSYNCHRONOSS TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - UNAUDITED\n(Amounts in tables in thousands, except for per share data or unless otherwise noted)\nnoncontrolling interests could significantly increase or decrease the fair value estimates recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe changes in fair value of the Company\u2019s Level 3 redeemable noncontrolling interests during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 were as follows:\nBalance at December 31, 2020 $ 12,500\nFair value adjustment 286\nNet (income) loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests (286)\nBalance at September 30, 2021 $ 12,500\n5. Leases\nThe Company has entered into contracts with third parties to lease a variety of assets, including certain real estate, equipment, automobiles and other assets. The Company\u2019s leases frequently allow for lease payments that could vary based on factors such as inflation or the degree of utilization of the underlying asset. For example, certain of the Company\u2019s real estate leases could require us to make payments that vary based on common area maintenance charges, insurance and other charges. The Company\u2019s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nThe Company is party to certain sublease arrangements, primarily related to the Company\u2019s real estate leases, where it acts as the lessee and intermediate lessor.\nThe Company reflects finance leases as a component of Leases, non-current on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The finance leases were not material for the period ended September 30, 2021.\nTable of Content\nSYNCHRONOSS TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - UNAUDITED\n(Amounts in tables in thousands, except for per share data or unless otherwise noted)\nThe following table presents information about the Company's Right of Use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities at September 30, 2021:\nROU assets:\nNon-current operating lease ROU assets $ 27,629\nOperating lease liabilities:\nCurrent operating lease liabilities1\n$ 8,037\nNon-current operating lease liabilities 37,572\nTotal operating lease liabilities $ 45,609\n________________________________\n1 Amounts are included in Accrued Expenses on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nThe following table presents information about lease expense and sublease income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2021 September 30, 2021\nOperating lease cost1\n$ 2,235 $ 7,268\nOther lease costs and income:\nVariable lease costs1\n85 501\nOperating lease impairments1, 2\n642 1,794\nSublease income1\n(693) (2,471)\nTotal net lease cost $ 2,269 $ 7,092\n________________________________\n1 Amounts are included in Cost of revenues, Selling, general and administrative and/or Research and development based on the function that the underlying leased asset supports which are reflected in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n2 As part of the Company\u2019s continued cost savings initiatives, the Company closed certain office spaces and terminated various lease agreements. These actions resulted in a ROU asset impairment charge for the period, which was determined by the present value of the forecasted future cash flows for the remaining lease term.\nTable of Content\nSYNCHRONOSS TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - UNAUDITED\n(Amounts in tables in thousands, except for per share data or unless otherwise noted)\nThe following table provides the undiscounted amount of future cash flows included in our lease liabilities at September 30, 2021 for each of the five years subsequent to December 31, 2020 and thereafter, as well as a reconciliation of such undiscounted cash flows to our lease liabilities at September 30, 2021:\nOperating Leases\nRemaining 2021 $ 2,975\n2022 10,870\n2023 8,552\n2024 8,308\n2025 8,193\nThereafter 18,562\nTotal future lease payments 57,460\nLess: amount representing interest (11,851)\nPresent value of future lease payments (lease liability) $ 45,609\nThe following table provides the weighted-average remaining lease term and weighted-average discount rates for our leases as of September 30, 2021:\nOperating Leases:\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (years), weighted based on lease liability balances 6.06\nWeighted-average discount rate (percentages), weighted based on the remaining balance of lease payments 8.1%\nThe following table provides certain cash flow and supplemental noncash information related to our lease liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2021:\nOperating Leases:\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities $ 10,437\n6. Investments in Affiliates and Related Transactions\nSequential Technology International, LLC\nIn connection with the divestiture of the exception handling business of the Company in 2017, Synchronoss entered into a three-year Cloud Telephony and Support services agreement (\u201cCTS Agreement\u201d) to grant Sequential Technology International, LLC (\u201cSTIN\u201d) access to certain Synchronoss software and private branch exchange systems to facilitate exception handling operations required to support STIN customers.\nThe CTS agreement expired in the first quarter of 2020. At the time of the expiration, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with STIN. As part of the agreement, the Company received $1.6 million in exchange for certain hardware and system assets for the cloud telephony and remaining support service business.\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with STIN and AP Capital Holdings II, LLC (\u201cAPC\u201d) to divest its remaining equity interest in STIN as well as settle its paid-in-kind purchase money note (\u201cPIK note\u201d) and certain amounts due as of December 31, 2019 in consideration for a $9.0 million secured promissory note (the \u201cNote\u201d), which includes contingent consideration of up to $16.0 million. The Note has an 8% interest rate and a 3-year stated term. As part of the arrangement, APC acquired a majority stake of STIN. Additionally, in the event of a sale of STIN by APC and STIN at a future date, the Company shall receive 5% of such sale proceeds, after reducing the sale proceeds by any outstanding amounts of the above Note, including any earned contingent consideration. The Company determined the fair value of the Note as of the\nTable of Content\nSYNCHRONOSS TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - UNAUDITED\n(Amounts in tables in thousands, except for per share data or unless otherwise noted)\ntransaction date to be approximately $4.8 million. The Company determined the fair value of the Note using a discounted cash flow analysis, which discounts the expected future cash flows of the asset to determine its fair value. The fair value measurement is based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement. No gain or loss was recognized as a result of the transaction. As of September 30, 2021, the Company reassessed the fair value of the Note and there were no material changes.\n7. Debt\nOffering of Senior Notes\nOn June 30, 2021, the Company closed its underwritten public offering of $120.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.375% senior notes due 2026 at a par value of $25.00 per senior note (the \u201cSenior Notes\u201d). The offering was conducted pursuant to an underwriting agreement (the \u201cNotes Underwriting Agreement\u201d) dated June 25, 2021, by and among the Company and B. Riley Securities, Inc., as representative of the several underwriters (the \u201cNotes Underwriters\u201d). At the closing, the Company issued $125.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes, inclusive of $5.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes issued pursuant to the full exercise of the Notes Underwriters\u2019 option to purchase additional Senior Notes.\nThe Notes Underwriting Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants of the Company, customary conditions to closing, indemnification obligations of the Company and the Notes Underwriters, including for liabilities under the Securities Act, other obligations of the parties and termination provisions.\nOn June 30, 2021, the Company entered into an indenture (the \u201cBase Indenture\u201d) and a supplemental indenture (the \u201cFirst Supplemental Indenture\u201d and, together with the Base Indenture, the \u201cIndenture\u201d) with The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company National Association, as trustee (the \u201cTrustee\u201d), between the Company and the Trustee. The Indenture establishes the form and provides for the issuance of the Senior Notes.\nThe Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and rank equally in right of payment with all of the Company\u2019s existing and future senior unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The Senior Notes are effectively subordinated in right of payment to all of the Company\u2019s existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries, including trade payables. The Senior Notes bear interest at the rate of 8.375% per annum. Interest on the Senior Notes is payable quarterly in arrears on January 31, April 30, July 31 and October 31 of each year, commencing on July 31, 2021. The Senior Notes will mature on June 30, 2026, unless redeemed prior to maturity.\nThe Company may, at its option, at any time and from time to time, redeem the Senior Notes for cash in whole or in part (i) on or after June 30, 2022 and prior to June 30, 2023, at a price equal to $25.75 per Senior Note, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption, (ii) on or after June 30, 2023 and prior to June 30, 2024, at a price equal to $25.50 per Senior Note, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption, (iii) on or after June 30, 2024 and prior to June 30, 2025, at a price equal to $25.25 per Senior Note, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption, and (iv) on or after June 30, 2025 and prior to maturity, at a price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption. On and after any redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the redeemed Senior Notes.\nThe Indenture contains customary events of default and cure provisions. If an uncured default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes may declare the entire amount of the Senior Notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to be immediately due and payable. In the case of an event of default involving the Company\u2019s bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization, the principal of, and accrued and unpaid interest on, the principal amount of the Senior Notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will automatically, and without any declaration or other action on the part of the Trustee or the holders of the Senior Notes, become due and payable.\nTable of Content\nSYNCHRONOSS TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - UNAUDITED\n(Amounts in tables in thousands, except for per share data or unless otherwise noted)\nThe carrying amounts of the Company\u2019s borrowings were as follows:\nSenior Notes September 30, 2021 December 31, 2020\n8.375% Senior Notes due 2026\n$ 125,000 $ -\nUnamortized discount and debt issuance cost1\n(7,506) -\nCarrying value of Senior Notes $ 117,494 $ -\n________________________________\n1 Debt issuance are deferred and amortized into interest expense using the effective interest method.\nThe total fair value of the outstanding Senior Notes was $124.1 million as of September 30, 2021. The Company is in compliance with its debt covenants as of September 30, 2021.\nOn October 25, 2021, the Company entered into an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement (the \u201cSales Agreement\u201d) between the Company and B. Riley Securities, Inc. (the \u201cAgent\u201d), a related party, pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time, up to $18.0 million of the Company\u2019s 8.375% Senior Notes due 2026. Sales of the additional Senior Notes pursuant to the Sales Agreement, if any, may be made in transactions that are deemed to be \u201cat the market offerings\u201d as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d). The Agent is not required to sell any specific number of the additional Senior Notes, but the Agent will make all sales using commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its normal trading and sales practices on mutually agreed terms between the Agent and the Company. Under the Sales Agreement, the Agent will be entitled to compensation of 2.0% of the gross proceeds of all notes sold through it as the Company\u2019s agent.\nThe additional Senior Notes sold pursuant to the Sales Agreement will be issued pursuant to a prospectus dated August 28, 2020, as supplemented by a prospectus supplement dated October 25, 2021, in each case filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d) pursuant to the Company\u2019s effective Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-248133), which was declared effective by the Commission on August 28, 2020, and the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-260482), filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the Securities Act on October 25, 2021. The additional Senior Notes will be issued pursuant to the Indenture, dated June 30, 2021 (the \u201cBase Indenture\u201d), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated June 30, 2021 (the \u201cFirst Supplemental Indenture\u201d and, together with the Base Indenture, the \u201cIndenture\u201d) between The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the \u201cTrustee\u201d), and the Company.\nThe up to $18.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the additional Senior Notes that the Company may offer and sell under the prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus constitutes a further issuance of and are fungible with the $125.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes that the Company has issued to date, and form a single series of debt securities. The additional Senior Notes issued will have terms identical to the initial Senior Notes and will have the same CUSIP number as, and will be fungible and vote together with, the initial Senior Notes immediately upon issuance. The additional Senior Notes (when issued) and initial Senior Notes are listed and trade on The Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol \u201cSNCRL.\u201d\n2019 Revolving Credit Facility\nOn October 4, 2019, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement with Citizens Bank, N.A., for a $10.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bore interest at a rate equal to, at the Company\u2019s option, either (1) the arithmetic average of the LIBOR rate determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for the interest period (one, three or six months (or 12 months if agreed to by all applicable Lenders)) as selected by the Company relevant to such borrowing plus the applicable margin, or (2) a base rate determined by reference to the greatest of the\nTable of Content\nSYNCHRONOSS TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - UNAUDITED\n(Amounts in tables in thousands, except for per share data or unless otherwise noted)\nfederal funds rate plus 0.5%, the prime commercial lending rate as determined by the Agent, and the daily LIBOR rate plus 1.0%, in each case plus an applicable margin and subject to a floor of 0.5%.\nOn June 30, 2021, the Company paid off the outstanding balance and closed the Revolving Credit Facility.\nInterest expense\nThe following table summarizes the Company\u2019s interest expense:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2021 2020 2021 2020\n2021 Senior Notes due 2026\nAmortization of debt issuance costs $ 306 $ - $ 306 $ -\nInterest on borrowings 2,617 - 2,617 -\n2019 Revolving Credit Facility\nAmortization of debt issuance costs - 12 84 40\nCommitment fee - - - 4\nInterest on borrowings - 59 126 141\nOther1\n10 1 39 216\nTotal $ 2,933 $ 72 $ 3,172 $ 401\n________________________________\n1 Mainly finance leases\u2019 related interest expense\nDebt issuance costs are deferred and amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method.\n8.

The Company may choose to pay the Series B Preferred Dividends in cash or in additional shares of Series B Preferred Stock. In the event the Company does not declare and pay a dividend in cash on any Series B Dividend Payment Date, the unpaid amount of the Preferred Dividend will be added to the Liquidation Preference. As of September 30, 2021, the Liquidation Value and Redemption Value of the Series B Preferred Shares was $76.8 million.\nOn and after the fifth anniversary of the date of issuance, holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock will have the right to cause the Company to redeem each share of Series B Preferred Stock for cash in an amount equal to the sum of the current liquidation preference and any accrued dividends. Each share of Series B Preferred Stock will also be redeemable at the option of the holder upon the occurrence of a \u201cFundamental Change\u201d at (i) par in the case of a payment in cash or (ii) 1.5 times par in the case of payment in shares of Common Stock (such shares being, \u201cRegistrable Securities\u201d), subject to certain limitations on the amount of stock that could be issued to the holders of Series B Stock. In addition, the Company will be permitted to redeem outstanding shares of the Series B Preferred Stock at any time for the sum of the then-applicable Liquidation Preference and the accrued but unpaid dividends.

Other than with respect to the foregoing consent rights, the Series B Preferred Stock is non-voting stock.\nInvestor Rights Agreement\nOn June 30, 2021, the Company, B. Riley Financial and BRPI entered into an Investor Rights Agreement (the \u201cInvestor Rights Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement, for so long as affiliates of B.

There were no significant changes to Synchronoss Technologies, Inc. 2017 New Hire Equity Incentive Plan (the \u201cIncentive Plan\u201d) during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. As of September 30, 2021, there were 1.2 million shares available for the grant or award under the Company\u2019s 2015 Equity Incentive Plan and 0.4 million shares available for the grant or award under the Company\u2019s 2017 New Hire Equity Incentive Plan.\nOn November 1, 2021 the Incentive Plan was amended to increase the maximum number of shares of Common Stock authorized for issuance under the Incentive Plan by 566,711 shares from 1,500,000 shares to a new aggregate total of 2,066,711 shares.\nThe Company\u2019s performance cash awards granted to executives under the Long Term Incentive (\u201cLTI\u201d) Plans have been accounted for as liability awards, due to the Company\u2019s intent and the ability to settle such awards in cash upon vesting and the Company has reflected such awards in accrued expenses. As of September 30, 2021, the liability for such awards is approximately $0.2 million.\nTable of Content\nSYNCHRONOSS TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - UNAUDITED\n(Amounts in tables in thousands, except for per share data or unless otherwise noted)\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense related to all of the Company\u2019s stock awards included by operating expense categories, as follows:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2021 2020 2021 2020\nCost of revenues $ 432 $ 505 $ 1,289 $ 1,899\nResearch and development 725 890 2,276 3,392\nSelling, general and administrative 1,132 2,996 3,790 9,256\nTotal stock-based compensation expense $ 2,289 $ 4,391 $ 7,355 $ 14,547\nThe following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense related to all of the Company\u2019s stock awards included by award type, as follows:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2021 2020 2021 2020\nStock options $ 1,064 $ 1,701 $ 2,912 $ 5,289\nRestricted stock awards 1,373 2,626 4,412 8,922\nPerformance Based Cash Units (148) 64 31 336\nTotal stock-based compensation before taxes $ 2,289 $ 4,391 $ 7,355 $ 14,547\nTax benefit $ 420 $ 604 $ 1,357 $ 2,192\nThe total stock-based compensation cost related to unvested equity awards as of September 30, 2021 was approximately $10.9 million.

Income Taxes\nThe Company recognized an income tax benefit of approximately $7.3 million and $29.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The effective tax rate was approximately 24.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, which was higher than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to discrete income tax benefit recorded in the current quarter associated with the finalization of the Company\u2019s U.S. federal income tax return, which reflected a net operating loss that was carried back to prior tax years. Based on the final carryback claim, the Company recorded a discrete income tax benefit of $7.4 million and discrete income tax expense related to a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the amount of $2.1 million, all of which, if recognized, would impact the Company\u2019s effective tax rate. This increase was partially offset by pre-tax losses in jurisdictions where full valuation allowances have been recorded, pre-tax losses in jurisdictions which have a zero tax rate, and certain foreign jurisdictions projecting current income tax expense. The Company\u2019s effective tax rate was approximately 75.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, which was higher than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to the Company\u2019s ability to recognize certain loss carrybacks as a result of the enactment of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d) in the first quarter of 2020, the impact of the redemption of the Company\u2019s interest in STIN and valuation allowances recorded in domestic and foreign jurisdictions, partially offset by the impact of permanent book-tax differences. The Company continues to consider all available evidence, including historical profitability and projections of future taxable income together with new evidence, both positive and negative, that could affect the view of the future realization of deferred tax assets. As a result of the assessment, no change was recorded by the Company to the valuation allowance during the nine months ended September 30, 2021.\nOn March 11, 2021 the American Rescue Plan Act (\"ARPA\") was signed into law which is aimed at addressing the continuing economic and health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. This legislation relief, along with the previous governmental relief packages provide for numerous changes to current tax law. The Company does not anticipate that ARPA will have a material impact on its financial statements in the period ending September 30, 2021.\nDuring the quarter, the Internal Revenue Service commenced an audit of certain of the Company\u2019s prior year U.S. federal income tax filings, including the 2015 through 2020 tax years. The Company does not believe that the results of this audit will have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations.\nTable of Content\nSYNCHRONOSS TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - UNAUDITED\n(Amounts in tables in thousands, except for per share data or unless otherwise noted)\n11. Restructuring\nThe Company continues to execute certain restructurings to identify workforce optimization opportunities to better align the Company\u2019s resources with its key strategic priorities. A summary of the Company\u2019s restructuring accrual at September 30, 2021 and changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2021, are presented below:\nBalance at December 31, 2020 Charges Payments Other Adjustments Balance at September 30, 2021\nEmployment termination costs $ 1,580 $ 3,075 $ (2,130) $ - $ 2,525\n12. Earnings per Common Share (\u201cEPS\u201d)\nBasic EPS is computed based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the year. Diluted EPS is computed based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the year plus the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents using the treasury stock method and the average market price of the Company\u2019s common stock for the year. The Company includes participating securities (Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock - Participation with Dividends on Common Stock that contain preferred dividend) in the computation of EPS pursuant to the two-class method. The two-class method of computing earnings per share is an allocation method that calculates earnings per share for common stock and participating securities. During periods of net loss, no effect is given to the participating securities because they do not share in the losses of the Company.\nTable of Content\nSYNCHRONOSS TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - UNAUDITED\n(Amounts in tables in thousands, except for per share data or unless otherwise noted)\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in computing basic and diluted net income attributable to common stockholders per common share from continued and discontinued operations.\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2021 2020 2021 2020\nNumerator - Basic:\nNet loss from continuing operations $ (8,109) $ (5,622) $ (22,895) $ (9,666)\nNet income (loss) attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests - (60) 286 (242)\nPreferred stock dividend 1\n(1,722) (9,685) (33,728) (27,882)\nNet loss attributable to Synchronoss $ (9,831) $ (15,367) $ (56,337) $ (37,790)\nNumerator - Diluted:\nNet loss from continuing operations attributable to Synchronoss $ (9,831) $ (15,367) $ (56,337) $ (37,790)\nDenominator:\nWeighted average common shares outstanding - basic 85,646 42,360 57,662 41,777\nDilutive effect of:\nShares from assumed conversion of preferred stock2\n- - - -\nShares from assumed conversion of Performance Based Cash Units3\n- - - -\nWeighted average common shares outstanding - diluted 85,646 42,360 57,662 41,777\nBasic EPS\nEarnings per share:\nBasic $ (0.11) $ (0.36) $ (0.98) $ (0.90)\nDiluted $ (0.11) $ (0.36) $ (0.98) $ (0.90)\nAnti-dilutive stock options excluded - - - -\nUnvested shares of restricted stock awards 2,319 1,952 2,319 1,952\n________________________________\n1 Current year amounts include amortization of preferred stock issuance costs accelerated due to Series A redemption during the second quarter.\n2 The calculation does not include the effect of assumed conversion of preferred stock of nil and 13,426,155 shares for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively; and 14,767,557 and 12,963,664 shares for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively; which is based on 55.5556 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the preferred stock, because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.\n3 The calculation does not include the effect of assumed conversion of Performance Based Cash Units of 1,559,130 and nil shares for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively; and 776,303 and nil shares for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively; which is based on 1 share per 1 Performance Based Cash Unit, because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.\nTable of Content\nSYNCHRONOSS TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - UNAUDITED\n(Amounts in tables in thousands, except for per share data or unless otherwise noted)\n13.

The Company records a liability for specific legal matters when it determines that the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable, and the loss can be reasonably estimated. Management has also identified certain other legal matters where they believe an unfavorable outcome is not probable and, therefore, no reserve is established. Although management currently believes that resolving claims against the Company, including claims where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible, will not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u2019s view of these matters may change in the future. The Company also evaluates other contingent matters, including income and non-income tax contingencies, to assess the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and estimated extent of potential loss. It is possible that an unfavorable outcome of one or more of these lawsuits or other contingencies could have a material impact on the liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of the Company.\nOn May 1, 2017, May 2, 2017, June 8, 2017 and June 14, 2017, four putative class actions were filed against the Company and certain of its current and former officers and directors in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (the \u201cSecurities Law Action\u201d). After these cases were consolidated, the court appointed as lead plaintiff Employees\u2019 Retirement System of the State of Hawaii, which filed, on November 20, 2017, a consolidated complaint purportedly on behalf of purchasers of the Company\u2019s common stock between February 3, 2016 and June 13, 2017. On February 2, 2018, the defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated complaint in its entirety, with prejudice. Before that motion was decided, on August 24, 2018, lead plaintiff filed a consolidated amended complaint purportedly on behalf of purchasers of the Company\u2019s common stock between October 28, 2014 and June 13, 2017. On June 28, 2019, the Court granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint in its entirety, without prejudice, allowing lead plaintiff leave to amend its complaint. On August 14, 2019, lead plaintiff filed a second amended complaint. The second amended complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and it alleges, among other things, that the defendants made false and misleading statements of material information concerning the Company\u2019s financial results, business operations, and prospects. The plaintiff seeks unspecified damages, fees, interest, and costs. On October 4, 2019, the defendants moved to dismiss the second amended complaint in its entirety. On May 29, 2020, the Court granted in part and denied in part defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the second amended complaint, without prejudice. Plaintiff filed its motion for class certification on October 30, 2020.\nOn September 15, 2017, October 24, 2017, October 27, 2017 and October 30, 2017, Company shareholders filed derivative lawsuits against certain of the Company\u2019s current and former officers and directors and the Company (as nominal defendant) in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (the \u201cDerivative Suits\u201d). On May 24, 2018, the Court consolidated the Derivative Suits and appointed Lisa LeBoeuf as lead plaintiff. The lead plaintiff designated as the Operative Complaint the complaint she previously had filed on October 27, 2017. On March 11, 2019, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Operative Complaint, which the Court granted in substantial part on November 26, 2019. On December 10, 2019, the defendants filed a motion for reconsideration respecting the only claim to survive the motion to dismiss. On June 12, 2020,\nTable of Content\nSYNCHRONOSS TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - UNAUDITED\n(Amounts in tables in thousands, except for per share data or unless otherwise noted)\nthe Court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for reconsideration and dismissed the remaining claim without prejudice, allowing lead plaintiff leave to amend her complaint. On July 13, 2020, lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint. The amended complaint alleges claims related to breaches of fiduciary duties and unjust enrichment. The amended complaint\u2019s allegations relate to substantially the same facts as those underlying the Securities Law Action described above. On April 30, 2021, the Court dismissed Plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint in its entirety. Plaintiff filed a notice of appeal on May 28, 2021.\nOn March 7, 2019, Synchronoss shareholders, Beth Daniel and Juan Solis, filed a separate derivative lawsuit against certain of the Company\u2019s current and former officers and directors and the Company (as nominal defendant) in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, asserting substantially the same allegations as those underlying the Derivative Suits and the Securities Law Action described above (the \u201cDelaware Litigation\u201d). Plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and for the Company to take steps to improve its corporate governance and internal procedures. On May 20, 2019, the parties stipulated to a stay of the action pending a ruling on the pending motion to dismiss in the Derivative Suits.\nOn June 11, 2020 and June 12, 2020, Company shareholders filed derivative lawsuits against certain of the Company\u2019s current and former officers and directors and the Company (as nominal defendant) in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (the \u201cDemand Refused Derivative Complaints\u201d and together with the Delaware Litigation and the Derivative Suits, the \u201cDerivative Actions\u201d). The Demand Refused Derivative Complaints allege claims related to breaches of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and alleged violations of securities laws. The complainants\u2019 allegations relate substantially to the same facts as those underlying the Securities Law Action described above. The Demand Refused Derivative Complaints further allege that each plaintiff made a demand upon the Company\u2019s Board of Directors to investigate the alleged misconduct and that such demand was wrongfully refused. Plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and for the Company to take steps to improve its corporate governance and internal procedures. On October 20, 2020, the Court consolidated the actions and appointed co-lead plaintiffs. On December 4, 2020, co-lead plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint. On February 3, 2021, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the amended complaint.\nOn May 7, 2021, a mediation took place concerning the Securities Law Action and the Derivative Actions. On August 19, 2021, the parties to the Securities Law Action entered into a stipulation of settlement. The Court preliminarily approved the proposed settlement in the Securities Law Action on August 25, 2021, and a settlement hearing is scheduled for December 8, 2021. On September 9, 2021, the parties to the Derivative Actions entered into a stipulation of settlement. The Court preliminarily approved the proposed settlement in the Derivative Actions on September 14, 2021, and a settlement hearing is scheduled for November 30, 2021. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, the Company cannot predict the outcomes of the settlement hearings and gives no assurance that the asserted claims in the Securities Law Action or the Derivative Actions will not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position, prospects, or results of operations.\nIn the third quarter of 2017, the SEC and Department of Justice initiated investigations in connection with the June 2017 Announcement and certain transactions that the Company restated in the third quarter of 2018. The Company has received subpoenas, produced documents, and provided additional information to the government in connection with those investigations. On June 22, 2021, the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) staff verbally notified the Company that the staff has made a preliminary determination to recommend that the SEC initiate an enforcement action against the Company. This is in connection with certain financial transactions that the Company effected in 2015 and 2016 and its disclosure of and accounting for such transactions, which the Company restated in the third quarter of 2018 in its restated annual and quarterly financial statements for 2015 and 2016. That restatement followed the Company\u2019s announcement, on June 13, 2017 (the \u201cJune 2017 Announcement\u201d), that certain of its prior financial statements would need to be restated. Certain individuals, including certain former members of Synchronoss\u2019 management team, received similar notifications. The Company remains in discussions with the SEC staff regarding the prospect of resolving this matter through settlement. If the Company is unable to resolve this matter through settlement then it would expect to receive a \u201cWells notice\u201d from the SEC staff in connection with this matter. Although a Wells notice is neither a formal charge of wrongdoing nor a final determination that the recipient has violated any law, it is a formal notice that the SEC intends to bring an enforcement action against the recipient. Upon receipt of a Wells notice, the recipient has the opportunity to respond to the SEC staff\u2019s position before any formal enforcement action is taken. Due to the inherent uncertainties of government investigations, the Company cannot predict the outcome of these\nTable of Content\nSYNCHRONOSS TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - UNAUDITED\n(Amounts in tables in thousands, except for per share data or unless otherwise noted)\ngovernment investigations or the SEC staff\u2019s preliminary determination at this time and can give no assurance that the asserted claims will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position, prospects, or results of operations.\nExcept as set forth above, the Company is not currently subject to any other legal proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on its operations; however, the Company may from time to time become a party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. The Company is currently the plaintiff in several patent infringement cases. The defendants in several of these cases have filed counterclaims. Although the Company cannot predict the outcome of the cases at this time due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, the Company continues to pursue its claims and believes that the counterclaims are without merit, and the Company intends to defend all such counterclaims.\n14.

(\u201cSynchronoss\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) is a global software and services company that provides essential technologies for the mobile transformation of business. The Company\u2019s portfolio contains offerings such as personal cloud, secure-mobility, identity management and scalable messaging platforms, products and solutions. These essential technologies create a better way of delivering the transformative mobile experiences that the Company\u2019s customers need to help them stay ahead of the curve in competition, innovation, productivity, growth and operational efficiency.\nSynchronoss\u2019 products and platforms are designed to be carrier-grade, flexible and scalable, enabling multiple converged communication services to be managed across a range of distribution channels including e-commerce, m-commerce, telesales, customer stores, indirect and other retail outlets. This business model allows the Company to meet the rapidly changing converged services and connected devices offered by their customers. Synchronoss\u2019 products, platforms and solutions enable its customers to acquire, retain and service subscribers and employees quickly, reliably and cost-effectively with white label and custom-branded solutions. Synchronoss\u2019 customers can simplify the processes associated with managing the customer experience for procuring, activating, connecting, backing-up, synchronizing and sharing/collaboration with connected devices and contents from these devices and associated services. The extensibility, scalability, reliability and relevance of the Company\u2019s platforms enable new revenue streams and retention opportunities for their customers through new subscriber acquisitions, sale of new devices, accessories and new value-added service offerings in the Cloud. By using the Company\u2019s technologies, Synchronoss\u2019 customers can optimize their cost of operations while enhancing their customer experience.\nThe Company currently operates in and markets its solutions and services directly through its sales organizations in North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific.\nImpacts of COVID-19\nAlthough COVID-19 has not significantly affected our business to date, this disclosure discusses the actions the Company has taken in response to the COVID-19 crisis and the impacts that the situation has had on our business, as well as related known or expected trends.\nThe continued impact of COVID-19 on the macroeconomy and our business will depend significantly on the effectiveness and distribution of the vaccine, the potential cyclicality of the health crisis and the related public policy actions, market or regulatory needs or demands, the length and severity of the global economic slowdown, and whether and how our customers change their behaviors over the longer term. As a result, the demand for our products and services, as well as our overall results\nof operations, may be materially and adversely impacted by the pandemic for the duration of 2021 or longer, and we are unable to predict the duration or degree of such impact with any certainty.\nIn response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to execute our business continuity plans and evolve our operations to protect the safety of our employees while continuing to provide critical products and services to our customers. Some of the key initiatives the Company continues to execute include:\n\u2022Working safely and effectively with new and existing customers to continue to provide our products and services through the pandemic\n\u2022Continuing to enhance and modify our safety protocols for our employees\n\u2022Adjusting business operations to address circumstances created by COVID-19\n\u2022Maintaining effective governance and internal controls in a remote work environment\nAs the pandemic continues, we may revise our approach to these initiatives or take additional actions to meet the needs of our employees, customers and the Company and to continue to provide our products and services.\nRevenues\nWe generate most of our revenues on a per transaction or subscription basis, which is derived from contracts that extend up to 60 months from execution.\nThe future success of our business depends on the continued growth of Business-to-Business and Business-to-Business-to-Consumer driving customer transactions, and continued expansion of our platforms into the TMT Market globally through Cloud, Messaging and Digital markets. As such, the volume of transactions and our ability to expand our footprint in TMT and globally may result in revenue fluctuations on a quarterly basis.\nMost of our revenues are recorded in U.S. dollars but as we continue to expand our footprint with international carriers, we will become subject to currency translation that could affect our future net sales as reported in U.S. dollars.\nOur top five customers accounted for 69.2% and 69.0% of net revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, respectively. Contracts with these customers typically run for three to five years. Of these customers, Verizon accounted for more than 10% of our revenues in 2021 and 2020. The loss of Verizon as a customer would have a material negative impact on our company. However, we believe that the costs incurred and subscriber disruption by Verizon to replace Synchronoss\u2019 solutions would be substantial.\nCurrent Trends Affecting Our Results of Operations\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, we are actively monitoring the global situation. The extent of the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, impact on our customers and our sales cycles, impact on our business operations, impact on our customer, employee or industry events, and effect on our vendors, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to impact our business, financial condition or results of operations is uncertain, but may include, without limitation, impacts to our paying user growth as well as disruptions to our business operations as a result of travel restrictions, shutdown of workplaces and potential impacts to our vendors. Additionally, our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to U.S. dollars, our reporting currency, as well as changes in interest rates. Volatile market conditions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic have and may continue to negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows, due to a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which may cause our revenues to decline relative to our costs.\nBusiness from our Synchronoss Personal Cloud\u2122 solution has been driven by the growth in mobile devices globally that are becoming content rich. As these devices replace other traditional devices like PCs, the ability to securely back up content from mobile devices, sync it with other devices and share it with family, friends and business associates have become essential needs and subscriber expectations. Such devices include smartphones, connected cars, personal health and wellness devices and\nconnected home devices. The need for the contents of these devices to be stored in a common cloud are also expected to be drivers of our business in the longer term.\nBusiness from our traditional Synchronoss Messaging business (Email) has been driven by a resurgence in the need for white label secure messaging platforms that favor the Mobile Network Operator\u2019s (\u201cMNO\u201d) business objectives and are not beholden to the objectives of a sponsoring over-the-top (\u201cOTT\u201d) platform. We believe that messaging drives higher subscriber engagement than any other application in the market today and holds the potential to stimulate new revenue from traditional services and third-party brands. OTT global success has driven MNOs to look at opportunities to preempt and compete with the OTTs which has potential opportunity for Synchronoss\u2019 future growth to be driven by the need of TMT companies including (and especially) MNOs to embrace Messaging as a Platform (\u201cMaaP\u201d). MaaP will allow TMT and MNO\u2019s to converse with subscribers in an efficient, automated way by streamlining the costs and increasing the effectiveness of self-care, as well as yielding cross-sell upselling of service plans, devices, bundles, etc. The Synchronoss Advanced Messaging Platform provides state of the art RCS-driven features including the ability to support advanced Peer to Peer communications and introduce new revenue streams driven by commerce and advertising via Application-to-Person capabilities.\nCompanies in the TMT market all face the dilemma of attempting to pivot their businesses to digital execution in order to create experiences that meet the expectations of their subscribers, generate new revenues and streamline costs creating healthier margins at a faster time to market than they have ever operated before. Their challenges feature the lack of skill sets to conceptualize and run day to day digital operations and the lack of resources to integrate their legacy back end systems to enact digital experiences that achieve their business objectives. The growth of Synchronoss Digital Platforms will be driven by the ability to provide TMT companies\u2019 desire to obtain digital transformation solutions as quickly as possible while educating them on the ability to operate a digital business efficiently. Our Platform as a Service (\u201cPaaS\u201d) model provides a desirable alternative to heavy capital expenditure spending options often tried internally. The ability for our platforms to create low/no code, new customer digital journeys, virtually on the fly, gives TMT Companies the ability to operate new experiences and businesses without heavily investing in development resources.\nTo support our growth, which we expect to be driven by these favorable industry trends mentioned above, we will leverage modular components from our existing software platforms to build new products. We believe that these opportunities will continue to provide future benefits and position us for future revenue growth. We are also making investments in research and development of new products designed to enable us to grow rapidly in the mobile wireless market. Our purchase of capital assets and equipment may also increase based on aggressive deployment, subscriber growth and promotional offers for free or bundled storage by our major Tier 1 carrier customers.\nWe continue to expand our platforms into the converging TMT, MNO, and Digital spaces to enable connected devices to do more things across multiple networks, brands and communities. Our initiatives with our customers continue to grow both with regard to our current business as well as our new product offerings. We are also exploring additional opportunities to support our customer, product and geographic diversification strategies.\nDiscussion of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\nThree months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2020\nThe following table presents an overview of our results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2021 $ Change\n2021 2020 2021 vs 2020\nNet revenues $ 69,753 $ 68,636 $ 1,117\nCost of revenues1\n27,245 28,452 (1,207)\nResearch and development 15,368 20,885 (5,517)\nSelling, general and administrative 27,953 23,265 4,688\nRestructuring charges 1,485 820 665\nDepreciation and amortization 8,215 12,212 (3,997)\nTotal costs and expenses 80,266 85,634 (5,368)\nLoss from continuing operations $ (10,513) $ (16,998) $ 6,485\n________________________________\n1 Cost of revenues excludes depreciation and amortization which are shown separately.\nNet revenues increased $1.1 million to $69.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021, compared to the same period in 2020. The increase in revenue is primarily driven by growth in cloud subscribers and new digital license sales partially offset by non-recurring advanced messaging deals in the prior period.\nCost of revenues decreased $1.2 million to $27.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021, compared to the same period in 2020. The 2021 decrease was primarily attributable to continued efforts to streamline our business operations and reduce costs.\nResearch and development expense decreased $5.5 million to $15.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021, compared to the same period in 2020. The research and development costs decreased year over year mainly as a result of executed cost savings initiatives to streamline our workforce and reduce vendor spend.\nSelling, general and administrative expense increased $4.7 million to $28.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021, compared to the same period in 2020. Our selling, general and administrative expense excluding legal reserves decreased period over period as a result of the continued cost savings initiatives executed in year which included headcount reductions, reduced vendor spending and lower facility costs.\nRestructuring charges were $1.5 million and $0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which primarily related to employment termination costs as a result of the work-force reductions initiated in the current year to reduce operating costs and align our resources with our key strategic priorities.\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $4.0 million to $8.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021, compared to the same period in 2020. The 2021 decrease was primarily attributable to the expiration of amortizable acquired assets in combination with reduced capital expenditures mainly as a result of the data center consolidation project and efforts to streamline business operations, partially offset by the increased amortization of capitalized software.\nIncome tax. The Company recognized an income tax benefit of approximately $7.0 million and $8.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The effective tax rate was approximately 46.3% for the three months ended September 30, 2021, which was higher than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to discrete income tax benefit recorded in the current quarter associated with the finalization of the Company\u2019s U.S. federal income tax return, which reflected a net operating loss that was carried back to prior tax years. Based on the final carryback claim, the Company recorded a discrete income tax benefit of $7.4 million and discrete income tax expense related to a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the amount of $2.1 million, all of which, if recognized, would impact our effective tax rate. This increase was partially offset\nby pre-tax losses in jurisdictions where full valuation allowances have been recorded, pre-tax losses in jurisdictions which have a zero tax rate, and certain foreign jurisdictions projecting current income tax expense. The Company\u2019s effective tax rate was approximately 60.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2020, which was higher than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to the Company\u2019s ability to recognize certain loss carrybacks as a result of the enactment of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d) in the first quarter of 2020, the impact of the redemption of the Company\u2019s interest in STIN and valuation allowances recorded in domestic and foreign jurisdictions, partially offset by the impact of permanent book-tax differences.\nDiscussion of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\nNine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2020\nThe following table presents an overview of our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):\nNine Months Ended September 30, $ Change\n2021 2020 2021 vs 2020\nNet revenues $ 206,784 $ 222,293 $ (15,509)\nCost of revenues1\n83,024 93,403 (10,379)\nResearch and development 49,962 59,769 (9,807)\nSelling, general and administrative 67,790 74,249 (6,459)\nRestructuring charges 3,075 6,763 (3,688)\nDepreciation and amortization 26,567 33,852 (7,285)\nTotal costs and expenses 230,418 268,036 (37,618)\nLoss from continuing operations $ (23,634) $ (45,743) $ 22,109\n________________________________\n1 Cost of revenues excludes depreciation and amortization which are shown separately.\nNet revenues decreased $15.5 million to $206.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, compared to the same period in 2020. The decrease in revenue is primarily attributable to non-recurring license sales and one-time professional services in the prior period and the accounting treatment of deferred revenue due to a customer renewal as per ASC 606, which was signed in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. These changes were partially offset by growth in cloud subscribers and the acceleration of subscription revenue from the dissolution of a previous customer.\nCost of revenues decreased $10.4 million to $83.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, compared to the same period in 2020. The 2021 decrease was primarily due to continued efforts to streamline operations and reduce costs. These initiatives resulted in a significant decrease in cost of revenues driven mainly by data center consolidation, reduced vendor spending, and operating expense savings.\nResearch and development expense decreased $9.8 million to $50.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, compared to the same period in 2020. The research and development costs decreased year over year mainly as a result of executed cost savings initiatives to streamline our workforce and reduce vendor spend.\nSelling, general and administrative expense decreased $6.5 million to $67.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, compared to the same period in 2020. The 2021 decrease was primarily driven by cost savings initiatives that resulted in a decrease in employee costs, facilities, and external costs related to outside consultants and legal fees.\nRestructuring charges decreased $3.7 million to $3.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, compared to the same period in 2020, which primarily related to employment termination costs as a result of the work-force reductions initiated in the current year to reduce operating costs and align our resources with our key strategic priorities.\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $7.3 million to $26.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, compared to the same period in 2020. The 2021 decrease was primarily attributable to the expiration of amortizable\nacquired assets in combination with reduced capital expenditures mainly as a result of the data center consolidation project and efforts to streamline business operations, partially offset by the increased amortization of capitalized software.\nIncome tax. The Company recognized an income tax benefit of approximately $7.3 million and $29.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The effective tax rate was approximately 24.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, which was higher than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to discrete income tax benefit recorded in the current quarter associated with the finalization of the Company\u2019s U.S. federal income tax return, which reflected a net operating loss that was carried back to prior tax years. Based on the final carryback claim, the Company recorded a discrete income tax benefit of $7.4 million and discrete income tax expense related to a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the amount of $2.1 million, all of which, if recognized, would impact our effective tax rate. This increase was partially offset by pre-tax losses in jurisdictions where full valuation allowances have been recorded, pre-tax losses in jurisdictions which have a zero tax rate, and certain foreign jurisdictions projecting current income tax expense. The Company\u2019s effective tax rate was approximately 75.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, which was higher than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to the Company\u2019s ability to recognize certain loss carrybacks as a result of the enactment of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d) in the first quarter 2020, the impact of the redemption of the Company\u2019s interest in STIN and valuation allowances recorded in domestic and foreign jurisdictions, partially offset by the impact of permanent book-tax differences. The Company continues to consider all available evidence, including historical profitability and projections of future taxable income together with new evidence, both positive and negative, that could affect the view of the future realization of deferred tax assets. As a result of the assessment, no change was recorded by the Company to the valuation allowance during the nine months ended September 30, 2021.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of September 30, 2021, our principal sources of liquidity were cash provided by operations and the remaining proceeds from the financing transactions. Our cash and cash equivalents balance was $24.1 million at September 30, 2021. We anticipate that our principal uses of cash and cash equivalents will be to fund our business, including technology expansion and working capital.\nAt September 30, 2021, our non-U.S. subsidiaries held approximately $9.0 million of cash and cash equivalents that are available for use by our operations around the world. At this time, we believe the funds held by all non-U.S. subsidiaries will be permanently reinvested outside of the U.S. However, if these funds were repatriated to the U.S. or used for U.S. operations, certain amounts could be subject to U.S. tax for the incremental amount in excess of the foreign tax paid. Due to the timing and circumstances of repatriation of these earnings, if any, it is not practical to determine the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the amount.\nWe believe that our cash, cash equivalents, financing sources, and our ability to manage working capital and expected positive cash flows generated from operations in combination with continued expense reductions will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months from the filing date of this Form 10-Q based on our current business plans. However, as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy and our operations evolves, we will continue to assess our liquidity needs. Given the economic uncertainty as a result of the pandemic, we have taken actions to improve our current liquidity position, including, reducing working capital, reducing operating costs and substantially reducing discretionary spending. Even with these actions however, an extended period of economic disruption as a result of the continued global impact of COVID-19 could materially affect our business, results of operations, ability to meet debt covenants, access to sources of liquidity and financial condition. Our liquidity plans are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those described in the \"Forward-Looking Statements\" section of this MD&A and Part I,",
    "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOther than set forth below, there have been no material changes to our risk factors as previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A. included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nRisks Related to our Senior Notes, Series B Preferred Stock and Common Stock\nWe are subject to investigations relating to certain transactions in 2015 and 2016 that resulted in the restatement of our financial statements in 2018, and the Securities and Exchange Commission staff has preliminarily determined to recommend the initiation of an enforcement action against us in connection with that matter.\nOn June 22, 2021, the SEC staff verbally notified us that it has made a preliminary determination to recommend that the SEC initiate an enforcement action against us in connection with certain financial transactions that we effected in 2015 and 2016 and our disclosure of and accounting for such transactions, which we restated in the third quarter of 2018 in our restated annual and quarterly financial statements for 2015 and 2016. That restatement followed our announcement on June 13, 2017 (the \u201cJune 2017 Announcement\u201d), that certain of our prior financial statements would need to be restated. Certain individuals, including current and former members of our management team, received similar notifications. We remain in discussions with the SEC staff regarding the prospect of resolving this matter through settlement. If we are unable to resolve this matter through settlement then we would expect to receive a \u201cWells notice\u201d from the SEC staff in connection with this matter. Although a Wells notice is neither a formal charge of wrongdoing nor a final determination that the recipient has violated any law, it is a formal notice that the SEC intends to bring an enforcement action against the recipient. Upon receipt of a Wells notice, the recipient has the opportunity to respond to the SEC staff\u2019s position before any formal enforcement action is taken.\nIn the third quarter of 2017, the SEC and Department of Justice initiated investigations in connection with the June 2017 Announcement and certain transactions that we restated in the third quarter of 2018. We have received subpoenas, produced documents, and provided additional information to the government in connection with those investigations.\nAt this time, we cannot predict with certainty what the outcome of these government investigations or the SEC staff\u2019s preliminary determination might be, but they could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, prospects and results of operations.\nDowngrades in our credit ratings may increase our future borrowing costs, limit our ability to raise capital, cause our stock price to decline or reduce analyst coverage, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nCredit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit rating assigned to us by each of the rating agencies may be subject to revision at any time. Factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, our financial position, conditions in and periods of disruption in any of our principal markets and changes in our business strategy. If weak financial market conditions or competitive dynamics cause any of these factors to deteriorate, we could see a reduction in our corporate credit rating. Since investors, analysts and financial institutions often rely on credit ratings to assess a company\u2019s creditworthiness and risk profile, make investment decisions and establish threshold requirements for investment guidelines, our ability to raise capital, our access to external financing, our stock price and analyst coverage of our stock could be negatively impacted by a downgrade to our credit rating.\nOur current or future debt securities or preferred equity securities, which would be senior to our common stock, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur Senior Notes and Series B Preferred Stock are senior to our common stock. In addition, in the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by offering debt or preferred equity securities, including medium term notes, senior or\nsubordinated notes and classes of preferred stock. Debt securities or shares of preferred stock will generally be entitled to receive interest payments or distributions, both current and in connection with any liquidation or sale, prior to the holders of our common stock. We are not required to offer any such additional debt or preferred equity securities to existing common stockholders on a preemptive basis, and we may generally issue any such debt or preferred equity securities in the future without obtaining the consent of our common stockholders. As a result, any such future offerings of debt securities or preferred equity securities may adversely affect the market price of the common stock.\nB. Riley Securities, Inc. and its affiliates (\u201cBRS\u201d) have significant influence over us and may have conflicts of interest that arise out of future contractual relationships it or its affiliates may have with us.\nAs of June 30, 2021, BRS owned 19.2% of our outstanding common stock and all of our Series B Preferred Stock. As a result, BRS holds significant influence over us as a significant shareholder and may have conflicts of interest that arise out of current or future contractual relationships it or its affiliates may have with us. In addition, for so long as BRS and its affiliates beneficially own at least 10% of our outstanding common stock, BRS will have the right to nominate one member of our board of directors pursuant to an investor rights agreement.\nAs a result of the foregoing arrangements, BRS has significant influence over our management and policies and over all matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors, amendment of our certificate of incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions. Further, if BRS and other significant shareholders of the Company were to act together on any matter presented for shareholder approval, they could have the ability to control the outcome of that matter. BRS can take actions that have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us or discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares, which could prevent shareholders from receiving a premium for their shares. These actions may be taken even if other shareholders oppose them.\nWe may be able to incur substantially more debt, which could have important consequences to investors.\nWe may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. The terms of the indenture governing the Senior Notes does not prohibit us from doing so. If we incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with the Senior Notes, the holders of that debt will be entitled to share ratably with you in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization or dissolution. This may have the effect of reducing the amount of proceeds paid to investors. Incurrence of additional debt would also further reduce the cash available to invest in operations, as a result of increased debt service obligations. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify.\nOur level of indebtedness could have important consequences to investors, because:\n\u2022it could affect our ability to satisfy our financial obligations, including those relating to the Senior Notes;\n\u2022a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations would have to be dedicated to interest and principal payments and may not be available for operations, capital expenditures, expansion, acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes;\n\u2022it may impair our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing in the future;\n\u2022it may limit our ability to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity;\n\u2022it may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry; and\n\u2022it may make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, our industry or the economy in general.\nOur operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to service our debt. If we fail to make a payment on the Senior Notes, we could be in default on the Senior Notes, and this default could cause us to be in default on other indebtedness, to the extent outstanding. Conversely, a default under any other indebtedness, if not waived, could result in acceleration of the debt outstanding under the related agreement and entitle the holders thereof to bring suit for the enforcement thereof or exercise other remedies provided thereunder. In addition, such default or acceleration may result in an event of default and acceleration of other indebtedness of the Company, entitling the holders thereof to bring suit for the enforcement thereof or exercise other remedies provided thereunder. If a judgment is obtained by any such holders, such holders could seek to collect on such judgment from the assets of the Company. If that should occur, we may not be able to pay all such debt or to borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if new financing were then available, it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us.\nHowever, no event of default under the Senior Notes would result from a default or acceleration of, or suit, other exercise of remedies or collection proceeding by holders of, our other outstanding debt, if any. As a result, all or substantially all of our\nassets may be used to satisfy claims of holders of our other outstanding debt, if any, without the holders of the Senior Notes having any rights to such assets.\nThe Senior Notes are unsecured and therefore are effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness that we currently have or that we may incur in the future.\nThe Senior Notes are not secured by any of our assets or any of the assets of our subsidiaries. As a result, the Senior Notes are effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness that we or our subsidiaries have currently outstanding or may incur in the future (or any indebtedness that is initially unsecured to which we subsequently grant security) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The indenture governing the Senior Notes does not prohibit us or our subsidiaries from incurring additional secured (or unsecured) indebtedness in the future. In any liquidation, dissolution, bankruptcy or other similar proceeding, the holders of any of our existing or future secured indebtedness and the secured indebtedness of our subsidiaries may assert rights against the assets pledged to secure that indebtedness and may consequently receive payment from these assets before they may be used to pay other creditors, including the holders of the Senior Notes.\nThe Senior Notes are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries.\nThe Senior Notes are obligations exclusively of Synchronoss Technologies, Inc. and not of any of our subsidiaries. None of our subsidiaries is a guarantor of the Senior Notes, and the Senior Notes are not required to be guaranteed by any subsidiaries we may acquire or create in the future. Therefore, in any bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding, all claims of creditors (including trade creditors) of our subsidiaries will have priority over our equity interests in such subsidiaries (and therefore the claims of our creditors, including holders of the Senior Notes) with respect to the assets of such subsidiaries. Even if we are recognized as a creditor of one or more of our subsidiaries, our claims would still be effectively subordinated to any security interests in the assets of any such subsidiary and to any indebtedness or other liabilities of any such subsidiary senior to our claims. Consequently, the Senior Notes are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of any of our subsidiaries and any subsidiaries that we may in the future acquire or establish as financing vehicles or otherwise. The indenture governing the Senior Notes does not prohibit us or our subsidiaries from incurring additional indebtedness in the future. In addition, future debt and security agreements entered into by our subsidiaries may contain various restrictions, including restrictions on payments by our subsidiaries to us and the transfer by our subsidiaries of assets pledged as collateral.\nThe indenture under which the Senior Notes were issued contains limited protection for holders of the Senior Notes.\nThe indenture under which the Senior Notes were issued offers limited protection to holders of the Senior Notes. The terms of the indenture and the Senior Notes does not restrict our or any of our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to engage in, or otherwise be a party to, a variety of corporate transactions, circumstances or events that could have an adverse impact on your investment in the Senior Notes. In particular, the terms of the indenture and the Senior Notes do not place any restrictions on our or our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to:\n\u2022issue debt securities or otherwise incur additional indebtedness or other obligations, including (1) any indebtedness or other obligations that would be equal in right of payment to the Senior Notes, (2) any indebtedness or other obligations that would be secured and therefore rank effectively senior in right of payment to the Senior Notes to the extent of the values of the assets securing such debt, (3) indebtedness of ours that is guaranteed by one or more of our subsidiaries and which therefore is structurally senior to the Senior Notes and (4) securities, indebtedness or obligations issued or incurred by our subsidiaries that would be senior to our equity interests in our subsidiaries and therefore rank structurally senior to the Senior Notes with respect to the assets of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022pay dividends on, or purchase or redeem or make any payments in respect of, capital stock or other securities subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Notes;\n\u2022sell assets (other than certain limited restrictions on our ability to consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets);\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022create liens (including liens on the shares of our subsidiaries) or enter into sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022make investments; or\n\u2022create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to us from our subsidiaries.\nIn addition, the indenture does not include any protection against certain events, such as a change of control, a leveraged recapitalization or \u201cgoing private\u201d transaction (which may result in a significant increase of our indebtedness levels), restructuring or similar transactions. Furthermore, the terms of the indenture and the Senior Notes will not protect holders of the Senior Notes in the event that we experience changes (including significant adverse changes) in our financial condition, results of operations or credit ratings, as they do not require that we or our subsidiaries adhere to any financial tests or ratios or specified levels of net worth, revenues, income, cash flow, or liquidity. Also, an event of default or acceleration under our other indebtedness would not necessarily result in an Event of Default under the Senior Notes.\nOur ability to recapitalize, incur additional debt and take a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the Senior Notes may have important consequences for you as a holder of the Senior Notes, including making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Senior Notes or negatively affecting the trading value of the Senior Notes.\nOther debt we issue or incur in the future could contain more protections for its holders than the indenture and the Senior Notes, including additional covenants and events of default. The issuance or incurrence of any such debt with incremental protections could affect the market for and trading levels and prices of the Senior Notes.\nAn increase in market interest rates could result in a decrease in the value of the Senior Notes.\nIn general, as market interest rates rise, notes bearing interest at a fixed rate decline in value. We cannot predict the future level of market interest rates.\nAn active trading market for the Senior Notes may not develop, which could limit the market price of the Senior Notes or your ability to sell them.\nThe Senior Notes are listed on Nasdaq under the symbol \u201cSNCRL\u201d. We cannot provide any assurances that an active trading market will develop for the Senior Notes or that you will be able to sell your Notes. If the Senior Notes are traded after their initial issuance, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, our credit ratings, general economic conditions, our financial condition, performance and prospects and other factors. The underwriters of our Senior Note offering have advised us that they may make a market in the Senior Notes, but they are not obligated to do so. The underwriters may discontinue any market-making in the Senior Notes at any time at their sole discretion. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid trading market will develop for the Senior Notes, that you will be able to sell your Senior Notes at a particular time or that the price you receive when you sell will be favorable. To the extent an active trading market does not develop, the liquidity and trading price for the Senior Notes may be harmed. Accordingly, you may be required to bear the financial risk of an investment in the Senior Notes for an indefinite period of time.\nIn addition, there may be a limited number of buyers when you decide to sell your Senior Notes. This may affect the price, if any, offered for your Notes or your ability to sell your Notes when desired or at all.\nWe may issue additional Senior Notes.\nUnder the terms of the indenture governing the Senior Notes, we may from time to time without notice to, or the consent of, the holders of the Senior Notes, create and issue additional notes which will be equal in rank to the Senior Notes. We will not issue any such additional Notes unless such issuance would constitute a \u201cqualified reopening\u201d for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nThe rating for the Senior Notes could at any time be revised downward or withdrawn entirely at the discretion of the issuing rating agency.\nWe have obtained a rating for the Senior Notes. Ratings only reflect the views of the issuing rating agency or agencies and such ratings could at any time be revised downward or withdrawn entirely at the discretion of the issuing rating agency. A rating is not a recommendation to purchase, sell or hold the Senior Notes. Ratings do not reflect market prices or suitability of a security for a particular investor and the rating of the Senior Notes may not reflect all risks related to us and our business, or the structure or market value of the Senior Notes. We may elect to issue other securities for which we may seek to obtain a rating in\nthe future. If we issue other securities with a rating, such ratings, if they are lower than market expectations or are subsequently lowered or withdrawn, could adversely affect the market for or the market value of the Senior Notes.",
